.SH NAME
rdump \- generate a file list suitable for making backups
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdump
[
.IR OPTION
]
.IR FILELIST 
.IR DIR...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrdump\fR is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing
backups. \fBrdump\fR itself does not backup anything.
.PP
\fBrdump\fR prints a filelist to standard output. This list is relative
to FILELIST. Subsequent programs in a pipe line can be used to actually
implement to backup scheme. If FILELIST is empty or non existant all
files in DIR are dumped. This is the same as a null dump. After a run
a new FILELIST is written. No warning is given when FILELIST is an
existing file, it just gets overwritten by \fBrdump\fR. New runs will
print out only those files that have actually changed since the last
run, thereby making incremental backups possible.
.PP
Files are checked for changes by comparing the m_time (modification time),
if this time is NEWER than the m_time of FILELIST the pathname is printed
to standard output. All errors are written to standard error.
.PP
The general idea is to be very unix like and create a bunch of simple programs
which each do a their specific thing very well. With \fBrdump\fR and a
small shell script (50 lines) one can implement encrypted and compressed
backups.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h
Give an overview of the options.
.TP
\fB\-n
Honor .nobackup files. If such files are found the directory is not
printed to standard output.
.TP
\fB\-v
Be more verbose
.TP
\fB\-V
Print rdump's version.
.TP
\fB\-x
Stay on the local filesystem.
.TP
\fB\-0
Delimit all printed lists with NULL instead of newlines. This also
applies to the FILELIST.

.SH FILELIST
\fBrdump\fR write the FILELIST in the following format:
        MODE PATH
.PP
Where MODE is the st_mode from stat(2) and PATH is the path of the file. A
typical example is: 
        33216 bin/rdump

.SH OUTPUT
The output generated by \fBrdump\fR is formatted like:
        +|-MODE UID GID PATH
.PP
Where:
.TP
.B o +|-
plus or minus, indicating whether PATH should added or removed
.TP
.B o MODE
the st_mode from stat(2).
.TP
.B o UID
the numerical user id of PATH
.TP
.B o GID
the numerical group id of PATH
.TP
.B o PATH
the pathname
.PP
A typical example look like this:
        +33216 1000 1000 bin/rdump
.PP
Directories are always printed, as the modification time of directories
is not compared.
