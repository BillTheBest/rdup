So you want to make backups, but all the programs you find are to
complicated and even then want allow you to make compressed, encrypted
and remote backup? Then you might want to try rdup.

In this short guide I will tell what you need to do to get a backup
running:
* Installing rdup
* Configuration 
* Compressed backup
* Remote backup
* Extra features
* More information

I will not detail how rdup works or how the backup is done in 
technical sense, see rdup's documentation for that. This guide
is just to get people going with making backups.


* Installation:

libglib2.0-0
libfile-copy-recursive-perl

Download rdup from
<my url>

dpkg -i <deb> or use gdebi


* Configuration:

This is easy part. What do you want to backup and where do you
want to store the backup? Its best to keep backups on a different
partition or better yet on a different harddisk.

rdup-simple ~ /backup/$HOSTNAME

Will store you homedirectory in /backup/$HOSTNAME/YYYYMM/DD. So
for today and my host this will be: /backup/elektron/200705/09
Each day will be stored in a new directory.

rdup-simple ~ /etc /backup/$HOSTNAME

will backup /etc and your homedirectory to /backup/$HOSTNAME


* Compressed backup
Simple add the '-z' flag to rdup-simple:

rdup-simple -z ~ /backup/$HOSTNAME

Will gzip you backup.

* Remote backup
Install 'rdup' on the remote host, rdup needs some of the utilities to
be available on the remote host. After you have done that:

rdup-simple ~ ssh://user@remotehost/backup/$HOSTNAME

Will store your homedirectory on 'remotehost' in the directory
/backup/$HOSTNAME/YYYYMMDD 

* Extra features
You simple want to exclude some directories? Simple create
a file '.nobackup' in such directories and rdup will skip
them.

* More information
You can mail questions to rdup@miek.nl or directly to me miek@miek.nl.
More documentation can be found the manual pages of rdup and on the
website of rdup: miek.nl/projects/rdup
