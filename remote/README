The scripts in this directory implement a remote mirroring backup
scheme.
The filelist piped to sback.sh must be given to sftp which will
then ftp the files to the remote host, like this:

./rdup -N timestamp LIST dirs | ./sbackup.sh | sftp -C -b - user@host:


the throw.sh and catch.sh script work directory through ssh, like this:
./rdup LIST dir | ./remote/throw.sh  | ssh user@host remote/catch.sh 

throw.sh and catch.sh use their own "protocol" to transfer the files,
but tweaking throw.sh files can be encrypted (for instance), be aware
that the filesize of the file MUST NOT change.

By default all scripts work on /vol/backup/`hostname`/YYYYMM.
