The scripts in this directory implement a remote mirroring backup
scheme.
The filelist piped to sback.sh must be given to sftp which will
then ftp the files to the remote host, like this:

./rdup -N timestamp LIST dirs | ./sbackup.sh | sftp -C -b - user@host:

By default all scripts work on /vol/backup/`hostname`/YYYYMM.
