TODO: 
# rdup util: (this is all rel. minor)
o ignore or handle signals? Needed to decide what to do with the FILELIST
o better error handling on syscalls? bail out or try to continue?
o valgrind and g_free
o getline is GNU-ism, freebsd has fgetln
o make install. Use a /etc/rdup directory
o documentation updates

# rest/shell 
o make install/unstall targets need to be finished
o look into networking (for an example script, that is)
o shell script portability
o manual page for excl.sh?
o make uninstall

PARTLY DONE:
o consolidate shell script, write generic functions that can 
  by sourced and used.
  26 Dec 2006

DONE:
o -0 is not yet implemented
  rdup filelist is \n delimited, as you cannot parse nulls with scanf
  Our internal list is NEVER null delimited.

o make it more efficient, GSList is not the quickest
  data type from GLib. Performance/scalability.
  Switch to a tree type.

o valgrind rdup. Done the remaining leaks look to be coming
  from glib: (or I'm doing something stupid)

o portability, first try to compile it on FreeBSD
  It compiles just fine under FreeBSD - made an error using the autoconf
  tools
  25 Dec 2005

o the .nobackup files or not added to the filelist
  This is now done, allthough I think I've created a memleak
  in crawler.c
  25 Dec 2005

o improve error reporting
  All errors are printed to stderrr, and prefixed with "** ".
  No seperate function is needed for this.
  25 Dec 2005

o always use the full path
  call getcwd before crawling if the path wasn't absolute.
  25 Dec 2005

o restore utilities, like yesterday or hist
  yesterday.sh and hist.sh are added, 25 Dec 2005.

o make directory seperator a define
  done, 25 Dec 2005
