TODO: 
# rdup util: 
o ignore or handle signals? Needed to decide what to do with the FILELIST
  and the timestamp, at least sigpipe, fail gracefully.
o better error handling on syscalls? bail out or try to continue?
o getline is GNU-ism, freebsd has fgetln
# rel. minor:
o valgrind and g_free
o documentation updates
o ?

# test
o do a make install test

o graphic (GTK) frontend? What would it do?
        - specify what to backup
        - to where
        - how often, cron interface
        - systray info bubble - when doing backups

# rest/shell 
o shell script portability, date +%s is now also used...
o manual page for excl.sh?
o Encryption: it changes the file size! This means it cannot be
  directory done in a pipe - you first need to encrypt it and then
  do something with it
o hist.sh go back more months?
o where to place to aux. scripts? /usr/lib/rdup ??

PARTLY DONE:

DONE:
o implement -n for yesterday/hist
  29 Dec 2006, core function is there, but is it not finished yet
  1 Jan, finished it.

o make uninstall
  30 Dec 2006

o handle difference between relative and absolute links
  30 Dec 2006

o Add dryrun to all scripts, which makes them echo all the stuff
  -N (dry run)
  30 Dec 2006

o consolidate shell script, write generic functions that can 
  by sourced and used.
  26 Dec 2006
  29 Dec 2006

o make install. Use a /etc/rdup directory
  27 Dec 2005: make install was implemented

o -0 is not yet implemented
  rdup filelist is \n delimited, as you cannot parse nulls with scanf
  Our internal list is NEVER null delimited.

o make it more efficient, GSList is not the quickest
  data type from GLib. Performance/scalability.
  Switch to a tree type.
  27 Dec 2005
  
o valgrind rdup. Done the remaining leaks look to be coming
  from glib: (or I'm doing something stupid)

o portability, first try to compile it on FreeBSD
  It compiles just fine under FreeBSD - made an error using the autoconf
  tools
  25 Dec 2005

o the .nobackup files or not added to the filelist
  This is now done, allthough I think I've created a memleak
  in crawler.c
  25 Dec 2005

o improve error reporting
  All errors are printed to stderrr, and prefixed with "** ".
  No seperate function is needed for this.
  25 Dec 2005

o always use the full path
  call getcwd before crawling if the path wasn't absolute.
  25 Dec 2005

o restore utilities, like yesterday or hist
  yesterday.sh and hist.sh are added, 25 Dec 2005.

o make directory seperator a define
  done, 25 Dec 2005
