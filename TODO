TODO: 
o -0 is not yet implemented
o make it more efficient, GSList is not the quickest
  data type from GLib
o ignore or handle signals
o better error handling on syscalls
o make install/unstall targets need to be finished
o look into networking (for example script that is)

DONE:
o valgrind rdump. Done the remaining leaks look to be coming
  from glib: (or I'm doing something stupid)

o portability, first try to compile it on FreeBSD
  It compiles just fine under FreeBSD - made an error using the autoconf
  tools

o the .nobackup files or not added to the filelist
  This is now done, allthough I think I've created a memleak
  in crawler.c

o improve error reporting
  All errors are printed to stderrr, and prefixed with "** ".
  No seperate function is needed for this.

o always use the full path
  call getcwd before crawling if the path wasn't absolute.
