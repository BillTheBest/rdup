RELEASE NOTES

This is the first release of the new rdup branch version 1.1.x.

Why this new branch?

I wanted to implement some extra features which needed
some (extensive) code modifications. I did not want
to mess with the current stable release, hence a 1.1.x
branch.

What is the difference with 1.0.x?  (aka new features)
* there is now only one output format which always includes
  the files' contents;
* the new output includes: user- and groupnames and the modification
  timestamp of the file.

With this change the following new features were added:
* rdup now has a  -a  swith: restore atime when reading files;
* rdup-up now sets the mtime on files it creates;
* rdup-up sets the user- and groupname more correct.

This work led to the following changes:
* rdup has gotten the -P feature from rdup-up;
* loads of code cleanups.
* rdup-tr only processes from stdin to stdout
* rdup-up only processes stdin

Future work:
* make it possible for rdup to also read archives 
  (maybe from stdin, otherwise from file)
