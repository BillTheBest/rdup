# RELEASE NOTES for RDUP 1.1.0

This is the first release of the new rdup branch, version 1.1.x.

Why this new branch?

I (and because of user requests) wanted to implement some extra features
which needed (extensive) code modifications. I did not want to mess
with the current stable release, hence a 1.1.x branch. However 1.1.x
will obsolete 1.0.x soonish.

> What is the difference with 1.0.x?  (aka new features)

1. there is now only one default output format which always includes
   the files' contents;
2. the rdup output is now more comparable with the tar archive format, with
   the big difference of being able to *delete* files.
3. the new output includes: user- and groupnames and the modification
   timestamp of the file. They can now be correctly set on remote 
   systems. (I.e the uid 'bert' stays 'bert' even if the remote side
   using a different uid *numbers* for 'bert');
4. more efficient, files are only read once. In rdup 1.0.x both rdup
   and rdup-tr read files, in 1.1.x only rdup reads files.

With this change the following new features were added:

* `rdup` now has a `-a` switch: restore a-time when reading files;
* `rdup-up` now sets the m-time on files it creates, this is the default;
* `rdup-up` sets the user- and groupname more correct, see point 3. above.
* `rdup-tr` can now be run on remote systems, because it receives the 
   files' content on standard input.

This work led to the following changes:

* rdup has gotten the `-P` flag from rdup-up. This also makes the `-a`
  flag work even *if* you pipe the files' through external programs:
  they are only read once from disk;
* `rdup-tr` only processes from stdin to stdout;
* `rdup-up` only processes stdin;
* much more tests are added to the testsuite (`make check`);
* code cleanups.

Some future work will of course remain, but I'm happy with how
things turned out.
