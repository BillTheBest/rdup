The script in this directory implement hdup2, although not all
functionality is includedi, the core feature of hdup2 is present.
It has also one less bug, because tar's incremental backup features
are not used.

Use: ./rdup -N timestamp filelist dirs | ./hdup2.sh

And you will get a tar file with the contents of the output
of rdup. 

Hdup2 also offers encryption and remote backup. These features
can be easily added.
