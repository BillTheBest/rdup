TODO:

post 0.6.0:
* make  rdup-gzip, rdup-crypt, rdup-gpg not fail when they cannot de-*
  something. In that case just echo the original file. This will make
  it easier to deal with mix backups (50% gzipped, 50% not compressed).
* enable support for sparse files; When seeing a block of NULLs just
  do a seek in the file
* rdup-s3 bucket filename
    rdup-s3 --download bucket filename
* reverse the output of rdup, so directories come last. This way
  directories  can be made with the default permissions and these
  can 
  doesn't work if the backup is made as a none root users - you 
  will not be able to restore. BUT still...

:rdup utils:

:rdup:
o encrypted file names, is it worth the effort, needs to be done in
  rdup-snap, when reading a name mangle it with a key? (low prio)
o extended attributes support? How, both OS agnostic and with remote
  dumping?
o se linux support? See extended attributes
o generic extended attributes. Locally we can use gnu cp 
  - extended attributes are a todo. I would love to see this supported on
   a generic non-FS depended way and workable with remote dumps.

:tests:
o add conformence test; symlinks etc.

:porting:
o port extended attributes to FreeBSD
o cp -plr is gnuis. See rdup-snap-link.
