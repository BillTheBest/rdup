TODO:

split off the scripts

post 0.6.0:
* kill rdup-snap-link and put that into rdup-simple instead
* ...
* make  rdup-gzip, rdup-crypt, rdup-gpg not fail when they cannot de-*
  something. In that case just echo the original file. This will make
  it easier to deal with mix backups (50% gzipped, 50% not compressed).
* enable support for sparse files; When seeing a block of NULLs just
  do a seek in the file
* rdup-scripts; resume a backup
* filetype changes testing!
* rdup-snap-link
* rdup-snap-link; put this in rdup-simple and be done with it

o encrypted file names, is it worth the effort, needs to be done in
  rdup-snap, when reading a name mangle it with a key? (low prio)
  I think you can only hash the names
o extended attributes support? How, both OS agnostic and with remote
  dumping?
o se linux support? See extended attributes
o generic extended attributes. Locally we can use gnu cp 
  - extended attributes are a todo. I would love to see this supported on
   a generic non-FS depended way and workable with remote dumps.

:tests:
o add conformence test; symlinks etc.
