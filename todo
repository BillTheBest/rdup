TODO:
 - rdup internal filelist is fast becoming identical as its
   output. So any special reading of this list can go
   and we can just use stuff for entry.c
   extending this list also has other interesting applictions

:general:
- move to more glib functions
  + pcre regexp?
- massive move to glib, g_progname etc
- glib test framework also?
- test -0 for rdup-*
- check memory and see if we can do make it use less
  use g_free() more
- *testing* *testing* *testing* 
- paths in rdup-simple.sh for rdup-ln.sh
