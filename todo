:rdup:
o encrypted file names, is it worth the effort, needs to be done in
  rdup-snap, when reading a name mangle it with a key? (low prio)
  I think you can only hash the names
o extended attributes support? How, both OS agnostic and with remote
  dumping?
o se linux support? See extended attributes
o generic extended attributes. Locally we can use gnu cp 
  - extended attributes are a todo. I would love to see this supported on
   a generic non-FS depended way and workable with remote dumps.
