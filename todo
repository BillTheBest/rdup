TODO: 

o rethink the backup format 
o related - rethink the restore

:rdup utils: 
o limit modifier understand k/m/g suffixes
o check if monthday.sh handles multiple changes on 1 day
o split off rdup-utils and rdup-core?
o make hdup.pl first class citizen
o maximum errors....
o crypt.pl
o multiple backup dirs (ie. lame man's mirroring)

:rdup:
:tests:
add conformence test; symlinks etc. Must be done before 0.2.15

:doc:
manpages for the perl versions? They do the same, generic manpage?
move to rest for the format

:porting:
o port extended attributes to FreeBSD

:longer term - and harder:
o make the rdup-utils work with 1 backup directory, where people can
  forever incrementally dump files to. This applies more to the scripts
  then to rdup. Right now all scripts work on backupdir/YYYYMM 

o make it more efficient
  rewrite in ruby? Fold some of the scripts into eachother so we
  don't shuffle the data around that much.

:hdup2:
o make complete hdup2 clone based on rdup
  see hdup2 directory. Not finished, I have limited time for this

:NOT DONE:
o merging of rorrim.sh and mirror.sh 
  way to different to make this worth the trouble
o restore.sh: -n always on. No dump.sh doesn't do this
o make hist and yesterday understand -c flag? - makes no sense
o use full hostname not the short one. $HOST is just used...
  $HOST is way easier and more portable as it is in bash
