post 0.6.0:
make  rdup-gzip, rdup-crypt, rdup-gpg not fail when they cannot de-*
something. In that case just echo the original file. This will make
it easier to deal with mix backups (50% gzipped, 50% not compressed).

:install:

:rdup utils:

:rdup:
o encrypted file names, is it worth the effort, needs to be done in
  rdup-snap, when reading a name mangle it with a key? (low prio)
o extended attributes support? How, both OS agnostic and with remote
  dumping?
o se linux support? See extended attributes
o generic extended attributes. Locally we can use gnu cp 
  - extended attributes are a todo. I would love to see this supported on
   a generic non-FS depended way and workable with remote dumps.

:tests:
o add conformence test; symlinks etc.

:porting:
o port extended attributes to FreeBSD
o cp -plr is gnuis. See rdup-snap-link.
