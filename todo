TODO:

Fix the r_entry struct. New name and better
(and more sane support of the symlink), store
the link target separately.

more hardlink stuff

- actual use user and group
- actual closing and opening of stdin/0

Output always is in %c mode, no more filelist
more. Write 1 parser for this input for rdup-tr
and rdup-up, allow this to work with 0 delimited

default output becomes:
%p%T %t %b %u %U %g %G %l %s\n%n%C

internal filelist is needs also to be optimized

- add extended attributes? man 5 tar explains how to do it, but it
  is A LOT of work AND it is not portable over unixes...?

rdup-tr -> simple transform software
    other formats, etc
rdup -> pipe to childeren
