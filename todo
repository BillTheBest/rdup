o get the gui from sbackup - python based, but works
o has some sort of cron interface...?

:porting:
o port extended attributes to FreeBSD
o cp -plr is gnuis. Don't have time to port this...?
o on Solaris I sometimes get weird output from rdup, this
  is either a bug in my code or something weird in libgtk

:retention:
We make 1 backup per day, by default. This can be extended but for now
it is sufficient
from sbackup; keep logorithmic:
	- all from yesterday
	- 1   from each day last week
	- 1   per week from last month
	- 1   per month from last year
	- 1   per year further in the past
	- erase all others
