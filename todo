TODO:

Fix the r_entry struct. New name and better
(and more sane support of the symlink), store
the link target separately.

1.1.0-dev
Default output to include: 
    -%t (mod. time in epoch).
    -%U  completely new: username, - when undefined
    -%G  completely new: groupname, - when undefined

the rdup-up code can be converted to be used in rdup-tr
- remove \0 delim stuff - no consistently uses
- actual use user and group

Output always is in %c mode, no more filelist
more. Write 1 parser for this input for rdup-tr
and rdup-up, allow this to work with 0 delimited

default output becomes:
%p%T %t %b %u %U %g %G %l %s\n%n%C

internal filelist is needs also to be optimized

- fix -0 input everywhere
- use libarchive to make zip and/or iso 9660 files? why not?
  if the impact is low...
- more robust write() in rdup-tr
  input.
- add extended attributes? man 5 tar explains how to do it, but it
  is A LOT of work AND it is not portable over unixes...?
