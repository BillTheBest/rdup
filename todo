TODO: 

:longer term - and harder:
o make the rdup-utils work with 1 backup directory, where people can
  forever incrementally dump files to. This applies more to the scripts
  then to rdup. Right now all scripts work on backupdir/YYYYMM 

:hdup2:
o make complete hdup2 clone based on rdup
  see hdup2 directory
  I want to see this, but I don't have enough time for this.

o dirsplit

:rdup utils: 
o better error message if somebody forgets a -c or something
o make dump.sh and restore.sh work with a -c option
  put ssh in it, remote dump/restore. Ala @miekg@elektron.atoom.net
  from hdup. 
o when not root, don't chown... ? Or at least show no errors

:tests:
:doc:
:porting:

:NOT DONE:
o merging rorrim.sh and mirror.sh because they really really do
  the same thing? Add -r switch, for restore???
  They are too different to make this practical - it is better to have
  2 scripts, then to have 1 scripts that is too complex.

o restore.sh: -n always on?? Yeah, dump.sh doesn't do this...
  not needed

:DONE:
o restore.sh: -p option, to cut off a few leading dirs, just as patch?
  should be implemented in rorrim.sh
  30 Apr: implemented in rorrim.sh

o restore.sh, dump.sh -v: so show files
  29 Apr: fixed

o restore.sh: multiple restore directories?
  29 Apr: fixed

o make meta restore script: restore.sh in line with dump.sh
  28 Apr: started script, looks very much like dump.sh

o paths in scripts
  25 Apr 2006: added @sbindir@/@bindir@ to them

o add -c to gzip/crypt
  23 Apr 2006: done

o dump.sh add -z and -k
  23 Apr 2006: done

o monthday -c support + completely rewritten
  23 Apr 2006: done

o -z for unzip in hist.sh, yesterday.sh
  21 Apr 2006: done

o split up rdgrep.sh in dir and file grep?
  10 Apr 2006: done
  
o check relative filenames: hist.sh ../blaat
  09 Apr 2006: done, just works :)

o ported mirror.sh and hist.sh and yesterday.sh
  09 Apr 2006: done

o check cp -RP on symlinks to directories on linux/freebsd
  port to freebsd
  08/09 Apr 2006

o where to place to aux. scripts? /usr/lib/rdup ??
  14 Mar 2006: I just place them in /usr/sbin

o depend on 'ls -o' in hist.sh, could use some portability love
  5 Mar 2006; we now depend on stat...

o multiple backups same hosts, check incremental/full fails
  5 Mar 2006; check existance for 1 dir deeper

o Encryption: it changes the file size! This means it cannot be
  directory done in a pipe - you first need to encrypt it and then
  do something with it. yesterday.sh was updated as well.
  28 Feb 2006 - see crypt.sh and gzip.sh

o valgrind and g_free
  done, could use another look, but I find it acceptable
  22 Feb 2006
  
o port over some scripts from hdup2 to remove old backups
  22 Feb - not doing it

o ignore or handle signals? Needed to decide what to do with the FILELIST
  and the timestamp, at least sigpipe, fail gracefully.
  25 Jan - we just exit

o getline is GNU-ism, freebsd has fgetln
  configure adapted
  19 Jan. Ported

o shell script portability, date +%s is now also used...
  19 Jan. FreeBSD 6 has date +%s - enough for me...

o hist.sh go back more months?
  10 Jan

o implement -n for yesterday/hist
  29 Dec 2006, core function is there, but is it not finished yet
  1 Jan, finished it.

o make uninstall
  30 Dec 2006

o handle difference between relative and absolute links
  30 Dec 2006

o Add dryrun to all scripts, which makes them echo all the stuff
  -N (dry run)
  30 Dec 2006

o consolidate shell script, write generic functions that can 
  by sourced and used.
  26 Dec 2006
  29 Dec 2006

o make install. Use a /etc/rdup directory
  27 Dec 2005: make install was implemented

o -0 is not yet implemented
  rdup filelist is \n delimited, as you cannot parse nulls with scanf
  Our internal list is NEVER null delimited.
  26 Dec 2005
  27 Dec 2005
  
o make it more efficient, GSList is not the quickest
  data type from GLib. Performance/scalability.
  Switch to a tree type.
  27 Dec 2005
  
o valgrind rdup. Done the remaining leaks look to be coming
  from glib: (or I'm doing something stupid)

o portability, first try to compile it on FreeBSD
  It compiles just fine under FreeBSD - made an error using the autoconf
  tools
  25 Dec 2005

o the .nobackup files or not added to the filelist
  This is now done, allthough I think I've created a memleak
  in crawler.c
  25 Dec 2005

o improve error reporting
  All errors are printed to stderrr, and prefixed with "** ".
  No seperate function is needed for this.
  25 Dec 2005

o always use the full path
  call getcwd before crawling if the path wasn't absolute.
  25 Dec 2005

o restore utilities, like yesterday or hist
  yesterday.sh and hist.sh are added, 25 Dec 2005.

o make directory seperator a define
  done, 25 Dec 2005
