:rdup utils:
rdup server pkgs with only rdup-snap and rdup-snap-link??

:rdup:
o encrypted file names?
o -e option
o check extended attributes too? 
    Would be fairly easy?
o -0 also affects the exclude, handig?

:tests:
o add conformence test; symlinks etc.

o gpg decryption

o se linux support?
- extended attributes

:gui:
o a high level gui?
o get the gui from sbackup - python based, but works
o has some sort of cron interface...?

:porting:
o port extended attributes to FreeBSD
o cp -plr is gnuis. Don't have time to port this...?
o on Solaris I sometimes get weird output from rdup, this
  is either a bug in my code or something weird in libgtk
