TODO:

:install:

:rdup utils:
rdup server pkgs with only rdup-snap and rdup-snap-link??

:rdup:
o encrypted file names, is it worth the effort, needs to be done
rdup-snap, when reading a name mangle it with a key.
o -e option
o check extended attributes too? 
    Would be fairly easy?
o -0 also affects the exclude

:tests:
o add conformence test; symlinks etc.

o se linux support?
o generic extended attributes. Locally we can use copy
- extended attributes are a todo. I would love to see this supported on
a generic non-FS depended way and workable with remote dumps.

:porting:
o port extended attributes to FreeBSD
o cp -plr is gnuis. Don't have time to port this...?
