rdup:
    update manpage
    error handling

rdup-tr:
    with tar/pax output hardlinks must come last
    update manpage
    error handling

rdup-up:
    update manpage
    error handling

rdup-simple:
    error handling?
    manual page back?

general:
    re-test incremental backups

    add extended attributes? man 5 tar explains how to do it, but it
    is A LOT of work AND it is not portable over unixes...?

tests:
    eas_encrypt fails on Fedora-11?
    encrypt path test
    tweak almost correct input and let rdup crash

    backup
    add nobkacup
    backup gone in that directory?
