rdup:
    update manpage
    make metachanges more efficient - now it sends the entire file again
    (this needs a %P change + - and a m - for meta, only send the new
    meta data - rdup-{up,tr} need to grok this too)

    non-root ssh backups, if chown of a file fails (non-root sshfs) create
    a file <basename>._rdup_ that holds the uid:gid combo username:group
    is nicer

rdup-tr:
    with tar/pax output hardlinks must come last
    update manpage

rdup-up:
    update manpage

tests:
    tweak almost correct input and let rdup crash

    autom. tests...?
    for i in $(seq 0 100); do make check 2>/dev/null | grep '^# of expected'; sleep 1; done
