TODO:

:install:

:rdup utils:
sha1-sum the directory arguments for the internal filelist admin
store the config options to, to read them backup in, or complain
about not being given the right options.

:rdup:
o encrypted file names, is it worth the effort, needs to be done
  rdup-snap, when reading a name mangle it with a key.
o -e option
o check extended attributes too? 
  Would be fairly easy?
o se linux support?
o generic extended attributes. Locally we can use gnu cp 
  - extended attributes are a todo. I would love to see this supported on
   a generic non-FS depended way and workable with remote dumps.

:tests:
o add conformence test; symlinks etc.


:porting:
o port extended attributes to FreeBSD
o cp -plr is gnuis. Don't have time to port this...?
