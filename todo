- rdup internal filelist is fast becoming identical to its
  output. So any special reading of this list can go
  and we can just use stuff for entry.c
  extending this list also has other interesting applications
- with libnettle we have sha1 there too, so sha1.c can go
- remove a lot of parsing code - entry.c rdup.c have some
  incommon - check this. Less code -> less maintenance
- drop pcre3 and use regexp from glib
- i18n - it's ALL C now - so much more easy, than the 
  C/Perl/sh kludge we had
- use libarchive to make zip and/or iso 9660 files? why not?
  if the impact is low...
- -a or --atime-preserve in rdup (when used with -c) and
  also in rdup-tr
- -m for fs-up
- -a and -m exactly as in cpio - same semantics

:general:
- glib test unit framework also?
- test -0 for rdup-*
- paths in rdup-simple.sh for rdup-ln.sh
- add extended attributes? man 5 tar explains how to do it, but it
  is A LOT of work AND it is not portable over unixes...?
