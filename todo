TODO:

Kill the -c switch - error prone - use FUSE if you need this. Make me
use cp too.  Add howto.

Allows me to use cp in the perl program too, save copy recusive which
does not handle all the extended attributes. Fixes the -a options


:install:

:rdup utils:
rdup server pkgs with only rdup-snap and rdup-snap-link??

:rdup:
o encrypted file names?
o -e option
o check extended attributes too? 
    Would be fairly strait forward?

:tests:
o add conformence test; symlinks etc.

o gpg decryption

o se linux support?

:gui:
o a high level gui?
o get the gui from sbackup - python based, but works
o has some sort of cron interface...?

:porting:
o port extended attributes to FreeBSD
o cp -plr is gnuis. Don't have time to port this...?
o on Solaris I sometimes get weird output from rdup, this
  is either a bug in my code or something weird in libgtk
