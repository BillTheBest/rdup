===== Abstract ====
Easy (Personal) Backups with rdup

In an ideal world backups would not be necessary, with an unlimited
amount of memory and non failing hard disk and some form of version
management we could always retrieve past versions of our files.

Unfortunately we do need backups.

Although the act of backing up may seems trivial (just copy some files
to another medium), a number of constraints make it more difficult. 
Backups may need to be compressed, or encrypted. Backups might be copied
to another hosts. Backups may need to be split up in such a way that
each piece will fit on a CD or DVD. Incremental backups need to be
supported. And, maybe, the most important one: recovery of lost files
should be easy. Also backup tools should be file system agnostic and
should be very flexible in their use.

A lot of backup programs only provide a subset of these requirements or
focus on one or two items. Others will do everything and make setting up
and usage a pain.

Further more a backup tool should not re-invent the wheel.  This means
that it should use ssh for file transfers and not a whole new mechanism
to do secure authentication.  Tar can be used to pack files, other tools
can be used for encryption. 

Taking these requirements and thinking them through, the
conclusion is that the best backup program... does not backup anything.
Hence: rdup

What is rdup? rdup is an utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 [plan9]
way of doing backups. As said, rdup does not create backups. It only
prints a list of files that are changed, or all files in case of a null
dump, to standard output.

Subsequent programs in a shell pipe line can be used to actually
implement to backup scheme. Currently implemented is a local and
remote mirroring capability (with optional compression and/or
encryption), a tar based setup (which is in turn based upon
hdup2, see [hdup2]), and a external USB drive backup. Turn on 
the drive and your backup starts.

Note that restoring files when mirrored is as easy as 'cp'-ing the
backed up file to another location. 

rdup is still in its early development stage. Current development
centers around making the scripts as robust and end-user friendly as
possible.

===== Rough Poster Sketch ====

3 part setup: left, middle and right:
Goal of the poster: get people thinking about backups and
  how they might use rdup for their personal backups.


Left:
Somewhat general explanation about backups, archiving and short
time backups (mirroring).

Middle:
Picture of the rdup "architecture". In the center sits rdup and around
it hover some other elements: remote hard disk, external hard disk and 
some offline media.

Right:
This part explains what is seen in the middle picture. Arrows will be
drawn to specific parts in the picture.
