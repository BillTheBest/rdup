Poster Setup

3 part setup: left, middle and right:
Goal of the poster: get people thinking about backups and
  how they might use rdup for their personal backups.


Left:
Somewhat general explanation about backups, archiving and short
time backups (mirroring).

Middle:
Picture of the rdup "architecture". In the center sits rdup and around
it hover some other elements: remote hard disk, external hard disk and 
some offline media.

Right:
This part explains what is seen in the middle picture. Arrows will be
drawn to specific parts in the picture.
