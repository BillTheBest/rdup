all functionally of rdup-snap but then in a C program
needs recursive delete
hardlink cache for after the fact hard lnks creation
set write permission on directories where I want to 
write in - restore after the backup

rdup-up - update a directory tree with a rdup archive

remove files and directories that need to be removed
and add the files that need to be added

support rdup and rdup -c input
for rdup input, call an external program? Or just do copy-in-out?
