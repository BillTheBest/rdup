1/ TO BUILD

Run: autoconf && ./configure && make
(Tested on Linux)

As of version 0.0.2 getdelim is used, which is a GNUism, therefor
compilation on FreeBSD fails, also see TODO. There are more GNUism, like
'date +%s' which should also be removed.

2/ DIFFERENCE WITH RSYNC

While rsync really works well, I wanted to have the ability to gzip
and/or encrypt the backupped files. rsync can not do that, that's way I
wrote rdup, which, with the help of some scripts can do that.

3/ DOCUMENTATION

rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing backups.
rdup it self does not backup anything, it only print a list of absolute
filenames to standard output. Auxilary scripts are needed that act on
this list and implement the backup strategy.  This way rdup can be kept
lean and mean. Current the (stripped) rdup executable measures 12KB and
I don't expect that to increase much.

The manual page explains rdup's options and usage. See rdup(8).

The filelist as printed starts with the root of the filedump and then
decends into directories. This way all top level directories can be
created in sequence. If you process the files in the same order no magic
is needed to create directories that otherwise might be missing.

3.1/ FULL DUMP

So how do you actually make a backup with rdup then? First run:
rm -f timestamp && rdup -N timestamp FILELIST dir1

Every directory, file and symlink in dir1 will be printed to standard
out put, like this:
+33152 1000 1000 0 /home/miekg/svn/rdup/trunk/bin/.svn/.nobackup
+33216 1000 1000 528 /home/miekg/svn/rdup/trunk/bin/svnlog
+33216 1000 1000 441 /home/miekg/svn/rdup/trunk/bin/zlog
+33216 1000 1000 131 /home/miekg/svn/rdup/trunk/bin/zzz
+33152 1000 1000 0 /home/miekg/svn/rdup/trunk/bin/zzzzzz

Which says everything is new, that's the + sign in the first column.
Next to that is the st_mode field of lstat(2), which holds the type
of the file (dir, regular or symlink) and the protection bits.
Then we find the numeric user id and numeric group id. Then the
filesize in bytes and as last the there is the pathname.

To do a real backup you can use:
rm -f timestamp
rdup -N timestamp FILELIST dir | ./mirror.sh -b /vol/backup/

'mirror.sh' is a shell script which looks at the filetype and acts
accordingly. It copies the content of all files to the archive
directory, directories and symlinks are recreated.

Thus mirror.sh creates a mirror of the directories in the archive
directory.

By default it will put the files in /vol/backup/YYYYMM.

3.2/ INCREMENTAL DUMP

Just run:
rdup -N timestamp FILELIST dir1 | ./mirror.sh -b /vol/backup/ 
again.
This will use the contents of FILELIST and the date on `timestamp' and
will only print those files that are a newer then the m_time of file
timestamp.

If we were not piping the output to 'rmirror.sh' we would see:
-33152 0 0 0 bin/blaat
+16832 1000 1000 4096 bin/.svn

Saying that 'bin/blaat' is to be removed. bin/.svn is always printed
because that is a directory.

4/ AND NOW FOR SOME FUN

Note: the examples given here are simplified, you cannot use a simple
command, but need to use differentiate between directories, regular
files and symbolic links. See the example script 'mirror.sh' for an
implementation.

You want gzipped backups?
for i in `rdup FILELIST /home`; do
        cat $i | gzip -c > /vol/backup/$i
done

You want encrypted backups?
for i in `rdup FILELIST /home`; do 
        cat $i | mcrypt -F -k 'secret' -a blowfish --mode stream  > /vol/backup/$i
done

You want encrypted/gzipped backups?
for i in `rdup FILELIST /home`; do
        cat $i | gzip -c | \ 
        mcrypt -F -k 'secret' -a blowfish --mode stream  > /vol/backup/$i
done

You want a gzipped tar file of your files?
rdup FILELIST /home > tar_list && \
tar --create --T list -z --file myhostbackup.tar.gz

You want to exclude certain files?
for i in `rdup FILELIST /home | grep -v \*.bak`; do 
         cat $i > /vol/backup/$i
done

You want to include certain files?
for i in `rdup FILELIST /home | grep important`; do 
         cat $i > /vol/backup/$i
done

You want to dump your files on a remote machine?
rdup FILELIST /home > list
rsync --files-from=list user@remotehost.nl

As in true unix tradition the list can go on and on :-)
