1/ TO BUILD

Run:
autoreconf && ./configure && make (Linux)
autoheader259 && autoconf259 && ./configure && gmake (FreeBSD)

rdup depends on:
o Gmake for compilation
o Glib to build. Glib is the lowlevel C library of the
  GTK project. Configure will check for this.
o Perl for the scripts. 
o copy-recursive module for Perl
o rdup-snaphost depends on GNU cp to create the hardlinked directories

2/ DIFFERENCE WITH RSYNC

While rsync really works well, I wanted to have the ability to gzip
and/or encrypt the backupped files. rsync can not do that. That is why I
wrote rdup, which, with the help of some scripts will do that.

3/ DOCUMENTATION

rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing backups.
rdup it self does not backup anything, it only print a list of absolute
filenames to standard output. Auxilary scripts are needed that act on
this list and implement the backup strategy.  This way rdup can be kept
lean and mean. Current the (stripped) rdup executable measures 28 KB (on
AMD64) and I don't expect that to increase much.

The manual page explains rdup's options and usage. See rdup(1), for an
introduction into making backups see rdup-backup(1).

The filelist as printed starts with the root of the filedump and then
decends into directories. This way all top level directories can be
created in sequence. If you process the files in the same order no magic
is needed to create directories that otherwise might be missing. If you
use rdup-grep to exclude some directories - keep this in mind, they are
not automaticaly created.
