1/ HOW TO MAKE BACKUPS

1. What directories do you want to backup?
   (Let's say: /home)
2. Where do you want to store the backups?
   (Let's say: /vol/backup/`hostname`, this is the default)

By default mirror.sh will create a backup directory for
each year and month. Thus the current backup is put in
'/vol/backup/`hostname`/200601'  (January 2006 backup).

1.1/ LOCAL FULL DUMP

As root run:
rm -f /etc/rdup/HOME_TIMESTAMP /etc/rdup/HOMELIST  
/usr/bin/rdup -N /etc/rdup/HOME_TIMESTAMP /etc/rdup/HOMELIST /home |\
/usr/sbin/mirror.sh

When this completes it will print (or something very simular):
** #REG FILES  : 32
** #DIRECTORIES: 2521
** #LINKS      : 0
** #(RE)MOVED  : 2
** SIZE        : 139305 KB
** STORED IN   : /vol/backup/elektron/200601
** ELAPSED     : 42 s

1.2/ LOCAL INCREMENTAL DUMP

An incremental dump is easy, just run the above command again, but
be sure that HOME_TIMESTAMP and HOMELIST are created by the null
dump.
