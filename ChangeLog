   * new format character: %H: print the sha1 hash of the file
   * output changed to: %p%T %b %u %g %l %s %n\n"
   * the LIST syntax was changed to include the
     filename size. This was due to a weird bug
     on Solaris where mangled entries are written...
  ** BIG changes **
   * When a file changes size:
     when smaller: NULLs are inserted
     when larger: the file is broken off
   * No shell utils are installed anymore, only the wrappers
   * rdup-snapshot, rdup-mirror add -f option: do a full dump

  ** smaller changes **
   * Moved Makefile.in to GNUmakefile.in to force gmake usage

   * All documentation updated with the new names and some more updates
   * Don't install dump-here.sh or dump-here.sh.8
   * Added debian/ dir so a .deb package can be build
     (cd debian ; dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot)

   * Making backups with 0.2.17:
   	dump.sh -b /vol/backup/$HOSTNAME dir-to-back-up
	YYYYMM will be added

	mirror.pl will use the -b argument as-is, no magic
	there.
   * Restoring backups with 0.2.17:
   	resore.sh -b /tmp/RESTORE dir-to-restore

   -- misc. bugfixes and new features --
   scripts:
   * use dd for "catching" the files' content
   * eliminate the use of 'head' as this didn't work on freebsd
   * dump-here.sh must be edited before use (added exit 1)

01 May 2006: 0.2.10 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  -- tiny bugfixes + major restore updates --
   * rdup: formalize file handling in rdup:
     - plain files are accepted on the cmd line (they
       already were, but generated a (harmless) warning)
     - if files/dirs do not exist rdup skips them, instead
       of quiting
   * rdup.8: documentation updates, and make it more clear
     that rdup handles file arguments just fine.
   * NEW: restore.sh: added this as a wrapper around rdup and
     monthday.sh and rorrim.sh

11 Apr 2006: 0.2.7 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- bugfixes + restore features --

   * more signal handling was added to the shell scripts, 
     they now echo what file they were processing when 
     they received the signal

   * usbdump.sh: be more informative on failed backups
   * error messages cleanup

     (this keep 'dir' and 'dir/.nobackup' in the backup
   * mirror.sh: use chown -h for symlinks
   * mirorr.sh: mirror_suffix() use +DD.HH:MM again (Graham King)
   * dump.sh: create the top level backup dirs with 755
   * all scripts: enabled set -o nounset, to catch unbound vars


02 Mar 2006: 0.2.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>

   * gfunc.c: bug, close files when catting them in cat().
   * gfunc.c: bug, size check should come before switch.
   * crawler.c: bug, use DIR_SEP everywhere
   * crawler.c: removed the filestack, and added files
     directly to the tree, this eliminates half a the
     mallocs, cutting down on rdup's memory req. 
     It is not faster (rdup is I/O bound)
   * rdup.c: removed the printing of directories when finished.
   * rdup.c: -vv now prints the processed files to standard error.
     (Usefull when doing a remote backup)

     spaces.


23 Feb 2006: 0.2.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- major feature release --
   * output changes:
     - directory size is always set to zero
   * Added -F FORMAT option that allows you 
     to specify the exact output of rdup 
     (Patch from Aaron Bader)
   * Added -r: show only removed files
   * Added -m: only show new/modified files
     (Both from Aaron Bader)
   * -0 semantics changed: now only applies to 
     the internal filelist. If you want a NULL use
     '\0' in the -F FORMAT string
   * Documentation was updated to reflect the current code
   * strerror() is now also printed more often
   * add ferror() check to cat() in gfunc.c
   * renamed excl.sh to rdgrep.sh (rdup-grep)
   * various small bits: typo's, check for signals more often.


16 Feb 2006: 0.2.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * the output format was changed: 
     the path_size was added to it
   * a -c option was added, which concatenate the file's
     output to standard output. This is done to make 
     remote backups more easy. This also changes rdup's output!
   * a -s <size> option was added which will only print
     out files that are smaller then a certain size.
   * A beginning was made with a perl impl. of hdup2, which 
     runs on top of rdup.
   * rmirror and mirror are combined into mirror.sh
   * all shared stuff was refactored
   Code:
   * Various typo's are fixed
   * -Wextra was dropped to allow compilation with older gcc's.
   * functions that weren't exported are now declared static.
   * Moved TODO to todo


25 Jan 2006: 0.2.0 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Jumped to version 0.2.0.
   Build:
   * Reworked autoconf, autoREconf && ./configure && make
     must now be used to compile rdup
   Code:
   * Ported to FreeBSD, getdelim.c was added for that.
     Also test compiled it on Mac OS X with Fink.
   * Signal handling for SIGPIPE and SIGINT was implemented,
     we now print an error when receiving such a signal.


18 Jan 2006: 0.1.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * hist.sh updated, it goes back for 3 months now
   * yesterday.sh now works correctly 
   * mirror.sh/rmirror.sh now create suffixes for backup
     files based on their creation time. The suffix 
     used is +MONTHDAY.HH.MM.


06 Jan 2006: 0.1.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * All scripts were completely reworked, local
     and remote backing up is now working.
   * End-user script were improved, excl.sh is now
     a working example. Everything is much more 
     enduser friendly
   * Documentation and man pages were improved and
     updated to reflect the modifications in the scripts.
   Code:
   * refactored printing in gfunc.c, this was a minor change.


02 Jan 2006: 0.1.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Use strcmp instead of g_ascii_strcasecmp() as
     case is significant in unix fs
   * Don't gzip the files by default with backup.sh
   * added mirror/dump.sh which is an example wrapper
     script for backupping.
   * Manual pages were updated.


31 Dec 2005: 0.1.0 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Bumped version as rdup matures rapidly
   * Small fixes to the scripts 
   * Test infrastructure was added


30 Dec 2005: 0.0.4 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Add the filesize to rdup's output. This change is 
     not backwards compatible. The output now is
     +/-MODE UID GID SIZE FILENAME
     SIZE = filesize in bytes
   * Added explicit timestamp file as suggest by Boris Goldowsky 
     (-N FILE, where the m_time of FILE is taken is the filestamp)
   Scripts:
   * Added remote directory with a script that can be piped
     to 'sftp b - user@remotehost'. This is a poor mans rsync - fully
     working though.
   * catch.sh and throw.sh are another remote backup implementation which
     allow encryption and zipping, only caveat is that the filesize
     MUST not change when fiddling with the contents of a file.
   * added hdup/ directory. The script in there implements the 
     core functionality of hdup2.
   Docs:
   * Started LaTeX document describing features and output
     of rdup and its scripts.
   Source:
   * Removed dump_type, backuptype is now implicitly stored in
     opt_timestamp (0 -> full, !0 -> inc)
   * Added -Os, this wipes 2K of the rdup exe (16%)
   * Ran 'rats':
     - take care getopts is not hit by a buffer overrun. 
     - Also removed potential race.


28 Dec 2005: 0.0.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Reworked the source directory slighty, all mirror scripts
     are now in their own directory (mirror/)
   * Lots of documentation updates


26 Dec 2005: 0.0.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Renamed to rdup.
   * rdup now uses GTree * instead of GSList *, making
     to incremental dump 100 times faster. 
   * make install target was added. /etc/rdup is the configuration
     directory of rdup
   * I'm now using rdup to backup my homesystem


25 Dec 2005: 0.0.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   - First public release -
   * Fully working, but not all features implemented
   * Fully documented.
   * The supplied shell script implement one possible
     backup scheme. Feel free to add more
   * Look at the TODO for what needs to be done
