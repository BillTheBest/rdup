   Feb 2006: 0.2.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- major feature release --
   * Added -F FORMAT option that allows you 
     to specify the exact output of rdup 
     (Patch from Aaron Bader)
   * Added -r: show only removed files
   * Added -m: only show new/modified files
     (Both from Aaron Bader)
   * output changes:
     -directory size is always zero
   * -c was removed: use %C in the -F format string
   * Documentation was updated to reflect the current code


16 Feb 2006: 0.2.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * the output format was changed: 
     the path_size was added to it
   * a -c option was added, which concatenate the file's
     output to standard output. This is done to make 
     remote backups more easy. This also changes rdup's output!
   * a -s <size> option was added which will only print
     out files that are smaller then a certain size.
   * A beginning was made with a perl impl. of hdup2, which 
     runs on top of rdup.
   * rmirror and mirror are combined into mirror.sh
   * all shared stuff was refactored
   Code:
   * Various typo's are fixed
   * -Wextra was dropped to allow compilation with older gcc's.
   * functions that weren't exported are now declared static.
   * Moved TODO to todo


25 Jan 2006: 0.2.0 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Jumped to version 0.2.0.
   Build:
   * Reworked autoconf, autoREconf && ./configure && make
     must now be used to compile rdup
   Code:
   * Ported to FreeBSD, getdelim.c was added for that.
     Also test compiled it on Mac OS X with Fink.
   * Signal handling for SIGPIPE and SIGINT was implemented,
     we now print an error when receiving such a signal.


18 Jan 2006: 0.1.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * hist.sh updated, it goes back for 3 months now
   * yesterday.sh now works correctly 
   * mirror.sh/rmirror.sh now create suffixes for backup
     files based on their creation time. The suffix 
     used is +MONTHDAY.HH.MM.


06 Jan 2006: 0.1.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * All scripts were completely reworked, local
     and remote backing up is now working.
   * End-user script were improved, excl.sh is now
     a working example. Everything is much more 
     enduser friendly
   * Documentation and man pages were improved and
     updated to reflect the modifications in the scripts.
   Code:
   * refactored printing in gfunc.c, this was a minor change.


02 Jan 2006: 0.1.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Use strcmp instead of g_ascii_strcasecmp() as
     case is significant in unix fs
   * Don't gzip the files by default with backup.sh
   * added mirror/dump.sh which is an example wrapper
     script for backupping.
   * Manual pages were updated.


31 Dec 2005: 0.1.0 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Bumped version as rdup matures rapidly
   * Small fixes to the scripts 
   * Test infrastructure was added


30 Dec 2005: 0.0.4 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Add the filesize to rdup's output. This change is 
     not backwards compatible. The output now is
     +/-MODE UID GID SIZE FILENAME
     SIZE = filesize in bytes
   * Added explicit timestamp file as suggest by Boris Goldowsky 
     (-N FILE, where the m_time of FILE is taken is the filestamp)
   Scripts:
   * Added remote directory with a script that can be piped
     to 'sftp b - user@remotehost'. This is a poor mans rsync - fully
     working though.
   * catch.sh and throw.sh are another remote backup implementation which
     allow encryption and zipping, only caveat is that the filesize
     MUST not change when fiddling with the contents of a file.
   * added hdup/ directory. The script in there implements the 
     core functionality of hdup2.
   Docs:
   * Started LaTeX document describing features and output
     of rdup and its scripts.
   Source:
   * Removed dump_type, backuptype is now implicitly stored in
     opt_timestamp (0 -> full, !0 -> inc)
   * Added -Os, this wipes 2K of the rdup exe (16%)
   * Ran 'rats':
     - take care getopts is not hit by a buffer overrun. 
     - Also removed potential race.


28 Dec 2005: 0.0.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Reworked the source directory slighty, all mirror scripts
     are now in their own directory (mirror/)
   * Lots of documentation updates


26 Dec 2005: 0.0.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Renamed to rdup.
   * rdup now uses GTree * instead of GSList *, making
     to incremental dump 100 times faster. 
   * make install target was added. /etc/rdup is the configuration
     directory of rdup
   * I'm now using rdup to backup my homesystem


25 Dec 2005: 0.0.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   - First public release -
   * Fully working, but not all features implemented
   * Fully documented.
   * The supplied shell script implement one possible
     backup scheme. Feel free to add more
   * Look at the TODO for what needs to be done
