14 Feb 2009: 0.7.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  * rdup*: solaris fixes. It now compiles and
    runs on solaris
  * rdup: change configure so that it will check
    for a newer function in libarchive. If this
    function is not found, rdup-tr is not build
  * doc tweaks and typos

01 Feb 2009: 0.7.0 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  -- major bugfixes, internal filelist format change --
  - slowly going to a 1.0.0 release -
  * version bumped to 0.7.0 as the internal file list format
    has changed. Using this new version as a drop-in replacement
    for 0.6.6 you will get a larger backup then you expected.
  * rdup-backups.7: typo (Johann Kl√§hn)
  * rdup-simple.sh: check for a minimum of 2 arguments (Tom Hendrikx)
  * rdup-simple.sh: fix -f (full dump)
  * rdup-up: add mkpath (works like mkdir -p) function and fix -t option
    (reported by Tom Hendrikx)
  * rdup-simple.sh/rdup-ln.sh: only report errors on stderr, for the rest 
    use stdout (Tom Hendrikx)
  * rdup: honor .nobackup files again (Tom Hendrikx)
  * rdup: Add filesize and linktype to the internal filelist - this is mostly to
    better support hard- and softlinks.
  * rdup: allow comments in the internal filelist, this is completely
    useless except that rdup now writes a line describing what's in the
    filelist using a comment: '# blaa ' etc.
  * rdup, rdup-tr, rdup-simple: handle link removals better and add
    a test case that will test this specific bug (reported by Tom
    Hendrikx)
  * small document tweaks and cleanups


12 Jan 2009: 0.6.6 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  * fix to minor bug in rdup-simple which prevented local
    backups from working. (Tom Hendrikx)
  * do a fclose() in fs-up.c (Tom Hendrikx)


10 Jan 2009: 0.6.5 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  * rdup-simple back as rdup-simple.sh, re-written to 
    use rdup-tr and rdup-up
    (installs to /usr/lib/rdup)
  * rdup-ln.sh: small tweaks and bugfixes
  * rdup-tr: also handle files that should be removed
  * don't include glib/stdio.h as this needs a glib version
    which is too new. (Dag Wieers)


30 Dec 2008: 0.6.4 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
 - further refinements and tweaks -
  * rdup-up: further updates and refinements
  * rdup-up: added strippath() function to strip leading path components
  * doc: minor updates to the manual pages, added a rdup-simple like
    script to rdup-backups.7
  * rdup-ln.sh: a shell script for checking and copying a previous
    rdup backup. Depends on GNU date and GNU cp. Installs into 
    /usr/lib/rdup/. Previously a small script called rdup-snap-link
    did this.


17 Dec 2008: 0.6.4-rc1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - major feature enhancements, two new programs -
    + rdup-tr: transform rdup output to something else
    + rdup-up: update a directory tree with rdup archive

 * rdup: Added '%N' to the format string, which prints the
   path, but in case of soft- and hardlinks it will only
   print the link's name not the '-> target' part
 * rdup: rdup.1.in had a long deserved make-over
 * rdup: Print symlinks correctly when there named on the cmd line
 * rdup: regexp: don't use g_slist_next, but k->next in gfunc.c
 * rdup: Suid/sgid/sticky bit output was corrected
 * rdup-tr: Added rdup-tr; a tool to convert rdup output to
   (modified) rdup output, tar, pax or cpio files
 * rdup-tr: Don't compile rdup-tr if libarchive is not found
 * rdup-tr: rdup-tr.1 manpage
 * rdup-up: Added rdup-up; C version of rdup-snap
 * rdup-up: Added rdup-up.1 manpage
 * rdup-up: Support for fifos, pipes, devices
 * updated rdup-backups.7 as general info about backups with rdup
 * Set the copyright to 2009 already


11 Nov 2009: 0.6.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
 * make regular expressions actually work (patch from Crispin Boylan)


03 Nov 2008: 0.6.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
 * rdup-utils: completely removed from rdup(-core).
   There is now a seperate svn repos with those tools. 
 * rdup: Added -R switch, which will reverse rdup's output
   This is a depth first output, first the directories
   then the files.
 * rdup: Use libpcre3 for regular expressions, MUCH much more powerfull
   than the POSIX regex previously used. This does add an extra
   dependency for libpcre3 (requested by Sorin Ionescu)
 * rdup: support for named pipe's, sockets and character and
   block devices. The rdup-utils IGNORE these files.
   This overloads the size (%s) in case of block/character
   devices - then it is 'major,minor' numbers
 * rdup: always write the device out with 5 position for the 
   internal filelist. This could also have resulted in too large 
   incrementals.


31 Jul 2008: 0.6.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
 * Added support for amazon's S3 service: see s3-rdup
   this is not added to rdup-simple and probably never will,
   but examples are given in the manual page on how
   to use it.
 * crawler.c: removed new_dir argument for dir_crawl
   this would test if a directory is new and if so would
   include all the files in it. This did not work properly
   and would result into files being included in the backup, which 
   would otherwise would be skipped when doing an incremental
   (Louis-Dominique Dubeau)
 * debian/ directory erased as rdup is now included in Debian and there 
   are better working builds for Ubuntu on Launchpad
 * Remove translation stuff from Perl utils - Perl 5.10 has a
   problem with the hack I employed. Thanks to Dawid Ciezarkiewicz
   for lending his machine with Arch Linux (and Perl 5.10)
 * Remove the -a flag from rdup and all the utils. Never like this hack anyway.


29 May 2008: 0.6.0 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
 -- 0.6.0 is 0.6.0-rc1 with following tweaks --
 * Fix a bug in which a directory can not be created
   in rdup-snap-link (Louis-Dominique Dubeau)


23 May 2008: 0.6.0-rc1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  -- i18n and hardlink support added: default output changed --
 * i18n support added, but nothing is translated yet
   - this is for the perl scripts and the rdup C core
   - shell scripts do not use i18n
 * hardlink support
   - symlink output has also changed to support this
   - each link is printed as 'link -> target'
   - filesize is overloaded to take the length of 'link' in this case
   - hardlinks have the file type 'h'
   - now we have: -, d, l and h types
   New sample output:

    +d 0751 1000 1000 11 0 /home/miekg/bin
    +h 0700 1000 1000 44 21 /home/miekg/bin/acx2 -> /home/miekg/bin/cx
    +h 0700 1000 1000 51 28 /home/miekg/bin/cx-hardlink -> /home/miekg/bin/cx
    +l 0777 1000 1000 24 18 /home/miekg/bin/t -> tt
    +- 0775 1000 1000 21 174 /home/miekg/bin/wifi

 * added gpg encryption/decryption to rdup-simple and rdup-restore
   (requested by: Jan Spakula)
 * rdup-simple: be more consistent for the naming of the internal
   filelist and timestamp files (Jan Spakula)
 * killed off rdup-cp and put that functionality in rdup-snap
 * implemented gettext for i18n use.

  * rdup-snap-link is the only script that optionally will
    check /etc/rdup
  * rdup: use ctime not the mtime
  * rdup: major rewrite of the core algorithm, it now uses
    a remove-list, new-list and posibly changed list - 
    only items that are on the changed list are ctime checked.
  * rdup: much better algorithm for detecting incremental filesystem
    changes; directory renames are now detected
  * rdup: the internal filelist is extended with a device number
    and a inode number; these are needed to detect directory moves.
    switch

   * Added rdup-gpg - encrypt with gpg, decryption makes use of
     gpg-agent, otherwise you need to type your passphrase for 
     every file
   * Force ordering of encryption and compressions. First compress
     then encrypt; all scripts do this now. 
   * Force ordering of decryption and decompression: First decrypt
     then decompress.

     a dir use rmtree, otherwise unlink
   * Add -E option to all utilities (reported by Joerg Rueppel)
   * Fix -e in rdup-snapshot and rdup-dump
   * removed spec file from distribution - there are multiple
     spec files to be found on the internet


26 Jan 2007: 0.3.6 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  -- minor bugfixes --
   * Small fixes for rdup-dump (Fabio Rossi)

   * Remove rdup-grep, as most functionality can be achieved with -E
   * Added rpm from: http://www.sisyphus.ru/srpm/rdup/spec
   * Add patch from Fabio Rossi to rdup-mirror, this add -u switch

15 Dec 2006: 0.3.4 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  -- bug fix release --
   * Output a prefix zero when printing permissions like: ---rwxrwx
   * When doing a remote backup and not running as root, rdup-snap

   * rdup: formalize file handling in rdup:
     - plain files are accepted on the cmd line (they
       already were, but generated a (harmless) warning)
     - if files/dirs do not exist rdup skips them, instead
       of quiting
   * rdup.8: documentation updates, and make it more clear
     that rdup handles file arguments just fine.
   * NEW: restore.sh: added this as a wrapper around rdup and
     monthday.sh and rorrim.sh
   * REMOVED: purge.sh, I want to focus on dump/restore. Everyone
     can write a rm -rf script
   * dump.sh, restore.sh: added -c user@remote switch to ease in 
     remote backups and remote restores.
   * man rdup.8: added -r/-m options.
   * doc: started tex documentation about rdup and its usage, 
     see the tex/ directory.
   * restore.sh, rorrim.sh: -p NUM (strip leading path components
     implmented)
   * Both dump.sh -c and restore.sh need testing.

11 Apr 2006: 0.2.7 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- bugfixes + restore features --
   * rdup: re-touch the timestamp file at the end. This way an interupted

   Porting:
   * mirror.sh/rorrim.sh: use cp -RP (works on FreeBSD) 
    (ghostcorps (at) gmail.com)

30 Mar 2006: 0.2.6 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- script updates and bugfixes --
   * more signal handling was added to the shell scripts,

   * mirror.sh: handle filetype changes better 
   * usb-dump.sh: display (zenity) progress dialog when backing up
     moved usb-dump.sh to tools/
   * hist.sh: correctly count backwards x months
   * scripts/ directory was removed
   * rename usb-dump.sh to dump-here.sh, as that is what it does
     

18 Mar 2006: 0.2.5 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- bugfixes --
   * usbdump.sh: be more informative on failed backups
   * error messages cleanup
   * indent is used to force coding style
   * added purge.sh script for deleting older backups
   * dump.sh and purge.sh now both have a manual page
     and are moved to the tools/ directory
   * patch for mirror.sh (add missing $) (Pavel Mracek)
   * Makefile cleanup


10 Mar 2006: 0.2.4 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- bugfixes --
   * crawler.c: when finding .nobackup don't remove the parent directory
     (this keep 'dir' and 'dir/.nobackup' in the backup
   * mirror.sh: use chown -h for symlinks
   * mirorr.sh: mirror_suffix() use +DD.HH:MM again (Graham King)
   * dump.sh: create the top level backup dirs with 755
   * all scripts: enabled set -o nounset, to catch unbound vars


02 Mar 2006: 0.2.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- features and bugfixes --
   * gfunc.c: bug, close files when catting them in cat().
   * gfunc.c: bug, size check should come before switch.
   * crawler.c: bug, use DIR_SEP everywhere
   * crawler.c: removed the filestack, and added files
     directly to the tree, this eliminates half a the
     mallocs, cutting down on rdup's memory req. 
     It is not faster (rdup is I/O bound)
   * rdup.c: removed the printing of directories when finished.
   * rdup.c: -vv now prints the processed files to standard error.
     (Usefull when doing a remote backup)
   * scripts: Added gzip.sh + manual page

     use rdup -c | crypt.sh | mirror -c 
   * scripts: Simplified yesterday.sh and hist.sh
   * scripts: Added -d switch to hist.sh
   * scripts: The default algorithm for encryption is set 
     to blowfish - if you want to change this you'll
     have to edit the scripts.
   * scripts: mirror.sh: added quotes around file names to protect
     spaces.


23 Feb 2006: 0.2.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   -- major feature release --
   * output changes:
     - directory size is always set to zero
   * Added -F FORMAT option that allows you 
     to specify the exact output of rdup 
     (Patch from Aaron Bader)
   * Added -r: show only removed files
   * Added -m: only show new/modified files
     (Both from Aaron Bader)
   * -0 semantics changed: now only applies to 
     the internal filelist. If you want a NULL use
     '\0' in the -F FORMAT string
   * Documentation was updated to reflect the current code
   * strerror() is now also printed more often
   * add ferror() check to cat() in gfunc.c
   * renamed excl.sh to rdgrep.sh (rdup-grep)
   * various small bits: typo's, check for signals more often.


16 Feb 2006: 0.2.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * the output format was changed: 
     the path_size was added to it
   * a -c option was added, which concatenate the file's
     output to standard output. This is done to make 
     remote backups more easy. This also changes rdup's output!
   * a -s <size> option was added which will only print
     out files that are smaller then a certain size.
   * A beginning was made with a perl impl. of hdup2, which 
     runs on top of rdup.
   * rmirror and mirror are combined into mirror.sh
   * all shared stuff was refactored
   Code:
   * Various typo's are fixed
   * -Wextra was dropped to allow compilation with older gcc's.
   * functions that weren't exported are now declared static.
   * Moved TODO to todo


25 Jan 2006: 0.2.0 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Jumped to version 0.2.0.
   Build:
   * Reworked autoconf, autoREconf && ./configure && make
     must now be used to compile rdup
   Code:
   * Ported to FreeBSD, getdelim.c was added for that.
     Also test compiled it on Mac OS X with Fink.
   * Signal handling for SIGPIPE and SIGINT was implemented,
     we now print an error when receiving such a signal.


18 Jan 2006: 0.1.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * hist.sh updated, it goes back for 3 months now
   * yesterday.sh now works correctly 
   * mirror.sh/rmirror.sh now create suffixes for backup
     files based on their creation time. The suffix 
     used is +MONTHDAY.HH.MM.


06 Jan 2006: 0.1.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * All scripts were completely reworked, local
     and remote backing up is now working.
   * End-user script were improved, excl.sh is now
     a working example. Everything is much more 
     enduser friendly
   * Documentation and man pages were improved and
     updated to reflect the modifications in the scripts.
   Code:
   * refactored printing in gfunc.c, this was a minor change.


02 Jan 2006: 0.1.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Use strcmp instead of g_ascii_strcasecmp() as
     case is significant in unix fs
   * Don't gzip the files by default with backup.sh
   * added mirror/dump.sh which is an example wrapper
     script for backupping.
   * Manual pages were updated.


31 Dec 2005: 0.1.0 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Bumped version as rdup matures rapidly
   * Small fixes to the scripts 
   * Test infrastructure was added


30 Dec 2005: 0.0.4 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Add the filesize to rdup's output. This change is 
     not backwards compatible. The output now is
     +/-MODE UID GID SIZE FILENAME
     SIZE = filesize in bytes
   * Added explicit timestamp file as suggest by Boris Goldowsky 
     (-N FILE, where the m_time of FILE is taken is the filestamp)
   Scripts:
   * Added remote directory with a script that can be piped
     to 'sftp b - user@remotehost'. This is a poor mans rsync - fully
     working though.
   * catch.sh and throw.sh are another remote backup implementation which
     allow encryption and zipping, only caveat is that the filesize
     MUST not change when fiddling with the contents of a file.
   * added hdup/ directory. The script in there implements the 
     core functionality of hdup2.
   Docs:
   * Started LaTeX document describing features and output
     of rdup and its scripts.
   Source:
   * Removed dump_type, backuptype is now implicitly stored in
     opt_timestamp (0 -> full, !0 -> inc)
   * Added -Os, this wipes 2K of the rdup exe (16%)
   * Ran 'rats':
     - take care getopts is not hit by a buffer overrun. 
     - Also removed potential race.


28 Dec 2005: 0.0.3 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Reworked the source directory slighty, all mirror scripts
     are now in their own directory (mirror/)
   * Lots of documentation updates


26 Dec 2005: 0.0.2 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   * Renamed to rdup.
   * rdup now uses GTree * instead of GSList *, making
     to incremental dump 100 times faster. 
   * make install target was added. /etc/rdup is the configuration
     directory of rdup
   * I'm now using rdup to backup my homesystem


25 Dec 2005: 0.0.1 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
   - First public release -
   * Fully working, but not all features implemented
   * Fully documented.
   * The supplied shell script implement one possible
     backup scheme. Feel free to add more
   * Look at the TODO for what needs to be done
