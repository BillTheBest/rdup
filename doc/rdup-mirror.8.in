.SH NAME
rdup-mirror \- mirror the files from the list on standard input

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdup-mirror
[
.IR OPTIONS
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrdup-mirror\fR copies the files it gets from standard input to the directory
specified with the \-b option. This script \fIimplements\fR the backup policy. 
.PP
If a file already exists in the backup directory it will be moved and
will get a suffix. This suffix is of the form: '+DD.HH:MM'. This suffix
is thus accurate to the minute. Multiple changes to files within one
minute are never caught by \fBrdup-mirrorl\fR.

.SH OPTION
.TP
.B \-a
Write the uid and gid information to the file's extended user attributes:
\'r_uid' and 'r_gid'. This option only works if \fBattr\fR is available
on the system. This currently works on Linux and Solaris 10.

This option is usefull when storing a remote backup. Normally these
backups are transferred by a non-root user. This user will not be able
to correctly set all uid/gid information. As a workaround
\fBrdup-mirror\fR will set the extended user attributes to the uid/gid as
it got them from standard input.
.TP 
.B \-b backupdir
Store the backup in \fIbackupdir\fR. This argument is mandatory.
.TP
.B \-c 
Used in conjunction with \fBrdup\fR's \-c. This will allow
\fBrdup-mirror\fR to be used for remote backups.
.TP
.B \-R
Restore mode. Always write the file to the target directory and
don't rename existing files to a +DD.HH:MM suffix.
.TP
.B \-f
Force a full dump.
.TP
.B \-v
Echo the files processed to standard error.
.TP
.B \-h
Short help message.
