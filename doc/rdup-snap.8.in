.SH NAME
rdup-snap \- create backup in a hard link backup

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdup-snap
[
.IR OPTIONS
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrdup-snap\fR copies the files it gets from standard input to the directory
specified with the \-b option. This script \fIimplements\fR the backup policy. 
It works on a directory that is hard linked or on an empty
directory. When the directory is empty a full dump is performed.
.PP
If a file (i.e. hard link) already exists in the backup directory it
will be removed. The end result will be that you will be left with
a complete mirror of your directory structure at the time of the backup.
Due to the use of hard links the amount of disk space used for the
backup is minimized.
.PP
Note, to create a hard linked backup directory use the script
\fIrdup-snapshot\fR which will create it for you. See rdup-snapshot(8)
for more information. This currently only works with GNU cp.
.PP
Also note that there are no restore utilities, this is because you 
can copy the backup to another location with the standard unix
commands.

.SH OPTION
.TP
.B \-a
Write the uid and gid information to the file's extended user attributes:
\'r_uid' and 'r_gid'. This option only works if \fBattr\fR is available
on the system. And currently only for Linux.
.TP 
.B \-b backupdir
Store the backup in \fIbackupdir\fR. This argument is mandatory.
.TP
.B \-c 
Used in conjunction with \fBrdup\fR's \-c. This will allow
\fBrdup-mirror\fR to be used for remote backups. 
.TP
.B \-v
Echo the files processed to standard error.
.TP
.B \-h
