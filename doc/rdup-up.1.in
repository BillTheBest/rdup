.SH NAME
@PACKAGE_NAME@-up \- update a directory tree with a rdup archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@-up
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
\fIDIRECTORY\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
With \fBrdup-up\fR you can update an (possibly) existing directory
structure with a rdup archive.

The rdup archive has to be given to \fBrdup-up\fR's standard input.

.SS Username and uids
\fBrdup\fR outputs both the user name and uid, the receiving system (which
may be a totally different system) checks if the user name and uid
match. If the user name and uid don't match the (numeric) uid is
used on the file. The same holds true for the group name and gid.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n
Do a dry-run and do not create anything on disk.
.TP
.B \-t 
Create DIRECTORY (ala mkdir -p) if it does not exist.
.TP
.B \-s N
Strip N path components from a pathname. If the resulting pathname is
empty after this operation it is skipped. Be careful however with the following
structure:

    /foo
    /foo/bar
    /foo/bar/bla.txt
    /foo/blork/bla.txt


With \fBrdup-up -s\fI2\fR this will leave:


    <empty>
    <empty>
    /bla.txt
    /bla.txt


And the last 'bla.txt' will \fIover write\fR the previous one, this will
happen without warnings.
.TP
.B \-r PATH
This option is related to the \-s option, but works different. The
string PATH is removed from (the beginning of) each pathname. With \fI-r
/home/backup\fR the pathname \fI/home/backup/bin/mycmd\fR becomes
\fI/bin/mycmd\fR. The same could be done with \fB-s 2\fR, but then you need
to count the slashes. Note \-s is always performed before \-r.
.TP
.B \-v
Be more verbose and echo the processed files to \fIstandard output\fR.
.TP
.B \-T
Show a table of contents of the rdup stream received (ala tar \-tf \-).
With \-T the directory argument is optional. \-T unsets any verbose (\-v) options.
.TP
.B \-q
Silence 'chown' failures even when running as root. This can be helpful when the 
file system does not implement 'chown' or disallows it ('sshfs' for instance).
.TP
.B \-h
A short help message.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the version.

.SH EXIT CODE
\fBrdup-up\fR return a zero exit code on success, otherwise 1 is returned.
