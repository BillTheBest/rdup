.SH NAME
@PACKAGE_NAME@-up \- update a directory tree with a rdup archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@-up
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
\fIDIRECTORY\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
With \fBrdup-up\fR you can update an (possibly) existing directory
structure with a rdup archive.

\fRrdup-up\fR reads \fBrdup \fI\-c\fR input.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n
Do a dry-run and do not create anything on disk.
.TP
.B \-t PATH
Create PATH (ala mkdir -p) if it does not exist.
.TP
.B \-s N
Strip N path components from a pathname. If the resulting pathname is
empty after this operation it is skipped. Be careful however with the following
structure:

    /foo
    /foo/bar
    /foo/bar/bla.txt
    /foo/blork/bla.txt


With \fBrdup-up -s\fI2\fR this will leave:


    <empty>
    <empty>
    /bla.txt
    /bla.txt


And the last 'bla.txt' will \fIoverwrite\fR the previous one.
.TP
.B \-r PATH
This option is related to the \-s option, but works differently. The
string PATH is removed from (the beginning of) each pathname. With \fI-r
/home/backup\fR the pathname \fI/home/backup/bin/mycmd\fR becomes
\fI/bin/mycmd\fR. The same could be done with \fB-s 2\fR, but then you need
to count the slashes.
.TP
.B \-v
Be more verbose and echo the processed files to \fIstandard output\fR.
.TP
.B \-vv
Be even more verbose and echo processed file \fIand\fR the uid and
gid information to standard output.
.TP
.B \-h
A short help message.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the version.

.SH EXIT CODE
\fBrdup-up\fR return a zero exit code on success, otherwise 1 is returned.
