.SH NAME
@PACKAGE_NAME@-up \- update a directory tree with a rdup archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@-up
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
\fIDIRECTORY\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
With \fBrdup-up\fR you can update an (possibly) existing directory
structure with a rdup archive.

.SS Username and uids
Rdup outputs both the username and uid, the receiving system (which
may be a totally different system) checks if the username and uid
match. If the username and uid don't match the (numeric) uid is
used on the file. The same holds true for the groupname and gid.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n
Do a dry-run and do not create anything on disk.
.TP
.B \-t PATH
Create PATH (ala mkdir -p) if it does not exist.
.TP
.B \-s N
Strip N path components from a pathname. If the resulting pathname is
empty after this operation it is skipped. Be careful however with the following
structure:

    /foo
    /foo/bar
    /foo/bar/bla.txt
    /foo/blork/bla.txt


With \fBrdup-up -s\fI2\fR this will leave:


    <empty>
    <empty>
    /bla.txt
    /bla.txt


And the last 'bla.txt' will \fIoverwrite\fR the previous one.
.TP
.B \-r PATH
This option is related to the \-s option, but works different. The
string PATH is removed from (the beginning of) each pathname. With \fI-r
/home/backup\fR the pathname \fI/home/backup/bin/mycmd\fR becomes
\fI/bin/mycmd\fR. The same could be done with \fB-s 2\fR, but then you need
to count the slashes. Note \-s is always performed before \-r.
.TP
.B \-v
Be more verbose and echo the processed files to \fIstandard output\fR.
.TP
.B \-vv
Be even more verbose and echo processed file \fIand\fR the uid and
gid information to standard output.
.TP
.B \-T
Show a table of contents of the rdup stream received (ala tar \-tf \-).
With \-T the directory argument is optional. \-T unset any verbose (\-v) options.
.TP
.B \-h
A short help message.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the version.

.SH EXIT CODE
\fBrdup-up\fR return a zero exit code on success, otherwise 1 is returned.
