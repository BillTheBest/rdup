.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rcat.sh
[
.IR OPTIONS
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrcat.sh\fR sends files so that \fBrmirror.sh\fR can receive
them at a remote location. rcat.sh reads the output of rdup
and generates a new list on standard output.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
The output of rcat.sh has the following charateristics:
        +|-MODE UID GID FILESIZE PATH\\nFILECONTENT
.PP
Where:
.TP
.B o +|-
plus or minus, indicating whether PATH should added or removed.
.TP
.B o MODE
the st_mode from stat(2).
.TP
.B o UID
the numerical user id of PATH. Note that if the first character of the
line is '-' (i.e. remove) the UID will be zero.
.TP
.B o GID
the numerical group id of PATH. Note that if the first character of the
line is '-' (i.e. remove) the GID will be zero.
.TP
.B o FILESIZE
the size of FILE. Note that if the first character of the line is '-'
(i.e. remove) the FILESIZE will be zero. If PATH is a directory FILESIZE
will also be zero. If PATH is a symbolic link the FILESIZE will be the
size of the link's target name.
.TP
.B o PATH
the pathname
.TP
.B o FILECONTENT
the (possibly binary) contents of the file.
.PP
A typical example look like this:
        +33216 1000 1000 11288 120 bin/rdup
        <120 bytes contents>

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-z
Gzip the file while sending (not yet implemented).

.SH EXAMPLES
Here we backup remotely to \fBremotehost\fR. The catched
files are dumped in \fB/vol/backup/remote\fR.
        rdup LIST dir | rcat.sh  | \\
        ssh user@remotehost rmirror.sh -b /vol/backup/remote

.SH FILES
Root of the dump file system defaults to /vol/backup/`hostname`, but can
be any location.
