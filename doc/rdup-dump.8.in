.SH NAME
rdup-dump \- dump a filesystem for a specifc host

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdup-dump
[
.IR OPTIONS
]
DIR|FILE
[
DIR|FILE
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrdup-dump\fR is a frontend for `rdup-mirror' and `rdup'. It will backup
all directories and files given on the command line. It tries to be smart with
respect to a full dump or an incremental dump. If the directories to
be backed up \fIdo not exist\fR in the backup directory a full dump
is assumed. Otherwise an incremental dump is performed.
.PP
Making local backups is as simple as:
      rdup-dump -b /vol/backup/$HOST ~ 
.PP
\fB~\fR is the directory to be backed up. Multiple directories
or files are allowed on the command line.
.PP
There is no default backup location. You must specify a \-b argument.
.PP
See rdup-mirror(8) for more information on how the files are placed
in the backup.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b backupdir
The backup directory. This is where the backup will be stored.

Note that \fBrdup-dump\fR will add the string YYYYMM to
the backup directory.
.TP
.B \-u
Unique backupdir, do not create a YYYYMM subdirectory structure.
.TP
.B \-n name
The \fIname\fR speficies an optional prefix for the
timestamp and filelist files. These are stored, by default, in
`@sysconfdir@/rdup'.

Normally the filelist and timestamp files are named like this:

$HOSTNAME.`basename DIR`.list and

$HOSTNAME.`basename DIR`.timestamp

where DIR is the first directory or file on the command line. Thus:
\fBrdup-dump\fR /home/miekg/bin, will lead to the following names:

elektron.bin.list and
elektron.bin.timestamp
.TP
.B \-c user@remotehost
Restore a backup on a remote host. This will create a pipeline of the
form:

rdup \-c \fIDIR|FILE\fR | ssh \fIuser@remotehost\fR rdup-mirror.pl \-c \-b \fIbackupdir\fR

There is no provisioning for \fBssh\fR so unless you have configured
\fBssh\fR to work without a passphrase you will be asked to supply one.
Also note that the PATH on the remote host should be set in such a way that all
the rdup-util scripts can be found.
.TP
.B \-E file
See \-E in rdup(8).
.TP
.B \-k keyfile
Encrypt the files while backing up with \fIkeyfile\fR. This option
inserts \fBcrypt.pl keyfile\fR in the pipeline. If both \fI-z\fR and
\fI-k\fR are given a file is first zipped and then encrypted.
.B \-a
Enable extended attributes. Write the uid/gid to the extended user
attributes r_uid and r_gid.
.TP
.B \-x
Pass \-x to rdup (stay in local filesystem).
.TP
.B \-z
Compress the files while backing up. This option
inserts \fBrdup-gzip\fR in the pipeline. If both \fI-z\fR and
\fI-k\fR are given a file is first zipped and then encrypted.
.TP
.B \-e
Store the the timestamp and filelist files together with the backup.
This allows for backups to USB-drives and such. Normally they
are stored in `@sysconfdir@/rdup'.

This option cannot be used when doing a remote backup.
.TP
.B \-f
Force a full dump.
.TP
.B \-v
Echo the files processed to standard error.
.TP
.B \-h
Show a short help message.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the version.
