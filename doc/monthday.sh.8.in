.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmonthday.sh\fR is part of the restore utilities of \fBrdup\fR.
.PP
\fBmonthday.sh\fR does not restore anything. It only "greps" the correct
files from the backup (or any other directory). If no argument is given
\fI+DAY\fR defaults to zero 0.
.PP
The \fI+DAY\fR argument is used as follows:
.PP
if zero then \fBmonthday.sh\fR will only select the latest files. Those
are the ones without any +DD.MM:HH suffix.
.PP
if non zero then \fBmonthday.sh\fR will select those files up until the
value of \fI+DAY\fR. This boils down to the following, in this
order:
.TP 
.B o
if \fI+DAY\fR is less then the smallest monthday suffix then
print the file with that suffix.
.TP 
.B o
if \fI+DAY\fR is larger then the largest monthday suffix then
print the file without any suffix.
.TP 
.B o
if the monthday suffix equals \fI+DAY\fR then print that file
.TP 
.B o
if the \fI+DAY\fR sits in the interval of monthday suffixes
then print the file that has the highest suffix, just
next to \fI+DAY\fR.
