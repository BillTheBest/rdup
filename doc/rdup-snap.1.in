.SH NAME
rdup-snap \- create backup in a hard link directory

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdup-snap
[
.IR OPTION
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrdup-snap\fR copies the files it gets from standard input to the directory
specified with the \-b option. This script \fIimplements\fR the backup policy. 
It works on a directory that is hard linked or on an empty
directory. When the directory is empty a full dump is performed.
.PP
If a file (i.e. hard link) already exists in the backup directory it
will be removed. The end result will be that you will be left with
a complete mirror of your directory structure at the time of the backup.
Due to the use of hard links the amount of disk space used for the
backup is minimized.
