.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrestore.sh\fR is a frontend for `rorrim.sh', `monthday.sh' and `rdup'. It will
restore from all the \fIFROM_DIR\fRs to \fITO_DIR\fR.

.PP
For the \fI+DAY\fR argument, see the rorrim.sh(8) manual page.

.PP
Restoring from a backup is as simple as:
      restore.sh -t /tmp/home /vol/backup/elektron/200604/home

Note: The restored files "inherit" the `/vol/backup/elektron/200604'
prefix. So the restored files are found in the directory:
`/tmp/home/vol/backup/elektron/200604/home'

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-t TO_DIR
This option is mandatory. It specifies the directory where the backup
should be restored in.
.TP
.B \-k keyfile
Decrypt the files while restoring with \fIkeyfile\fR. This option
inserts \fBcrypt.sh -d keyfile\fR in the pipeline. If both \fI-z\fR and
\fI-k\fR are given a file is first decrypted and then unzipped. This 
is ofcourse the opposite of what \fBdump.sh\fR does.
.TP
.B \-z
Decompress the files while restoring. This option
inserts \fBgzip.sh -d\fR in the pipeline. If both \fI-z\fR and
\fI-k\fR are given a file is first decrypted and then unzipped. This 
is ofcourse the opposite of what \fBdump.sh\fR does.
.TP
.B \-p NUM
Strip NUM leading components of the file names. See rorrim.sh(8) for
more details.
.TP
.B \-v
Echo the files processed to standard error.
.TP
.B \-h
Show a short help message.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the version.
