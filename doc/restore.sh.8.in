.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdump.sh\fR is a frontend for `mirror.sh' and `rdup'. It will backup
all directories and files given on the command line. It tries to be smart with
respect to a full dump or an incremental dump. If the directories to
be backed up \fIdo not exist\fR in the backup directory a full dump
is assumed. Otherwise an incremental dump is performed.
.PP
Making local backups is as simple as:
      dump.sh $HOSTNAME ~ 
.PP
The \fBNAME\fR argument speficies a prefix for the
timestamp and filelist files. If you use multiple \fBdump.sh\fR commands
they should have an unique \fINAME\fR argument.
.PP
\fBDIR\fR is the directory to be backed up. Multiple directories
are allowed on the command line.
.PP
The default backup location is `/vol/backup/`hostname''.

.SH OPTIONS

\fI-k\fR are given a file is first zipped and then encrypted.
.TP
.B \-z
