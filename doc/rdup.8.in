.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrdup\fR is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing
backups. \fBrdup\fR itself does not backup anything. It only prints
a list of files that are changed, or all files in case of a null dump.
It also handles files that are removed, allowing for correct incremental 
backups. All paths printed are absolute. See rdup-backups(8) for a
nice introduction.
.PP
The
.IR FILELIST
is a internal list \fBrdup\fR writes to, to keep track of which files
are in a backup. If you don't want this (i.e. make a full
backup), use \fI/dev/null\fR here. This file is needed to calculate
which files are to removed from a backup.
.PP
The
.IR DIRS/FILES
can be specified multiple times. These are the directories and files
you want to backup.
.PP
If the \fI\-N timestamp\fR option is not given, all paths founds are
printed. Only when a \fI\-N timestamp\fR file is given, times can be
compared and an incremental output can be generated.
.PP
\fBrdup\fR prints a filelist to standard output. 
Subsequent programs in a pipe line can be used to actually
implement to backup scheme. If FILELIST is empty or non existant all
files in DIR are dumped. This is the same as a null dump. After a run
a new FILELIST is written. No warning is given when FILELIST is an
existing file, it just gets overwritten by \fBrdup\fR. New runs will
print out only those files that have actually changed or are removed
since the last run, thereby making incremental backups possible.
.PP
Files are checked for changes by comparing the m_time (modification time),
if this time is NEWER than the m_time of FILELIST the pathname is printed
to standard output. When files are removed they are also printed to 
standard output, but they are prefixed with a '-'. See 
.B FORMAT
below. The default format \fBrdup\fR uses is: "%p%T %b %m %u %g %l %s %n\\n"

Note, that \fBrdup\fR also supports hashing of files, this makes it
possible to check the local hash with the hash of the backed up file.
.PP
All errors are written to standard error.
If the directory or file does not exist, they are skipped and a
warning is emitted.
.PP
The general idea is to be very unix like and create a bunch of simple programs
which each do a their specific thing very well. With \fBrdup\fR and a
small shell script (50 lines) one can implement encrypted and compressed
backups.

.SH BACKUP POLICY
As \fBrdup\fR doesn't backup anything, the backup policy; what you
backup, how you backup, how often and how you restore; is all left
to the scripts. See the Section \fBUTILITIES\fR for a run down on what
\fBrdup\fR's backup policy is.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-F format
Specify a printf-style format to use. See \fBFORMAT\fR below.
.TP
.B \-N timestamp
use the m_time of file \fBtimestamp\fR as the timestamp to decide what to
include in the incremental backup list. If \fBtimestamp\fR does not exist
of full dump is performed. 
.B rdup
will create/touch \fBtimestamp\fR after it has printed the file list.
This means if something goes wrong, you still have the original
timestamp.
.TP
.B \-E file
The file named 'file' contains a list of extended POSIX regular
expressions, one per line, that \fBrdup\fR will use to \fIexclude\fR
names. A '#' at the start of the line can be used to signal a comment.
Empty lines are discarded. The \fI\-0\fR option also affects the
format of this file.

If a directory is excluded, \fBrdup\fR won't descend in that directory,
so all files in that directory are also excluded.

The directories leading up to the directory to be backed up cannot
be excluded. If you use a command line like: 

        rdup /dev/null /home/miekg/bin

The directories '/home', '/miekg', '/bin' are always printed.

If you want to exclude the file '/home/miekg/blaat' you need to add
the following regular expression: '/home/miekg/blaat'. If you want
to exclude all .mozilla/cache directories of all users you can 
use '/home/.*/.mozilla/cache/.*'. This doesn't exclude the directory
itself. Note that \fBrdup\fR does not print directories with a
trailing slash.

.TP
.B \-V
Print rdup's version.
.TP
.B \-h
Give an overview of the options.
.TP
.B \-n
Don't honor .nobackup files. Normally if such files are found the directory is not
printed to standard output, now it is.
.TP
.B \-a
Read the uid and gid information from the file's extended user attributes:
\'r_uid' and 'r_gid'. This option only works if \fBrdup\fR was built with
xattr support. Currently this is supported and tested on Linux and
Solaris 10.

This option is usefull when restoring a remote backup. Normally these
backups are transferred by a non-root user. This user will not be able
to correctly set all uid/gid information. As a workaround rdup's
utilities will set the extended attributes for the file to store the
original uid/gid. With this option \fBrdup\fR will re-insert these
original uid/gid in its output.
.TP
.B \-c
Print the files' contents to standard output. This sets
the FORMAT string to: "%p%T %b %u %g %l %s\\n%n%C";

Note this creates a race condition: if a file changes in size after
rdup has crawled it and before it has been sent to the remote server,
the backup will fail. \fBrdup\fR will check for file size changes, but
this doesn't remove the race condition.
.TP
.B \-r
Only print removed files; entries that start with a `\-'. This 
option unsets \-m.
.TP
.B \-m
Only print modified/new files; entries that start with a `+'. This
option unsets \-r.
.TP
.B \-l
Local backups, do not check for file size changes.
.TP
.B \-v
Be more verbose. 
When used once, processed .nobackup files will be
printed to standard error. When used twice each path will also be
printed to standard error. This is usefull in case of a remote
backup (\fI\-c\fR) where the normal output is not seen.
.TP
.B \-s size
Only output files smaller then \fBsize\fR bytes. This can be used to limit
the amount of data to be transferred when doing a remote backup.
This option \fIonly\fR applies to files and symbolic links, \fInot\fR
to directories.
.TP
.B \-0
Delimit \fBfilelist\fR with NULL's instead of a newline. Use '\\0' in the
\fBformat\fR string to change \fBrdup\fR's output.
.TP
.B \-x
Stay on the local filesystem.

.SH BACKUPS
With:
        rm -f timestamp && rdup -N timestamp LIST DIR

All full-dump filelist is printed to standard output. And with:

        rdup -N timestamp LIST DIR

An incremental dump filelist is printed. The file \fItimestamp\fR
is used to safe the exact time of rdup's run. The file \fILIST\fR is
used to calculate the correct incremental dump list.

.SH FORMAT
The default format \fBrdup\fR uses is: "%p%T %b %u %g %l %s %n\\n"
.PP
The following escape sequences are understood by \fBrdup\fR:

        'p': '+' if file is new/modified, '-' if removed
        'b': permission bits from lstat(2)
        'm;: the file mode bits, st_mode from lstat(2)
        'u': uid
        'g': gid
        'l': path name length
        's': file size (zero if directory)
        'n': path
        't': time of modification (seconds from epoch)
        'H': the SHA1 hash of the file, all "0" for directories and
             symlinks
        'T': file type: -, l or d (normail file, symlink or directory)
        'C': the content of the file/link (none for directories)
.PP
To delimit the outout of \fBrdup\fR with NULLs you can use '\\0' in the
format string.

.SH FILELIST
\fBrdup\fR write the FILELIST in the following format:
        MODE PATH_SIZE PATH
.PP
Where MODE is the st_mode from stat(2), PATH_SIZE is the length of 
PATH. Where PATH is the path of the file. A typical example is: 
        33216 8 bin/rdup

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT 
The default output generated by \fBrdup\fR is formatted like:
        +|-TYPE BITS UID GID PATH_SIZE FILE_SIZE PATH
.PP
Where:
.TP
.B o +|-
plus or minus, indicating whether PATH should added or removed.
.TP TYPE
the type of the see %T in \fBFORMAT\fR.
.TP
.B o BITS
the permission of the file, this is a subset of the st_mode from
lstat(2).
.TP
.B o UID
the numerical user id of PATH. Note that if the first character of the
line is '-' (i.e. remove) the UID will be zero.
.TP
.B o GID
the numerical group id of PATH. Note that if the first character of the
line is '-' (i.e. remove) the GID will be zero.
.TP
.B o PATH_SIZE
the size of PATH. Normally this is not needed, but when PATH contains
spaces this can come in handy.
.TP
.B o FILE_SIZE
the size of file pointed to by PATH. Note that if the first character of the line is '-'
(.ie. remove) the SIZE will be zero. For directories this size will
always be zero.
.TP
.B o PATH
the pathname
.PP
A typical example look like this:
        +- 755 1000 1000 8 11288 bin/rdup
.PP
This example tells us, that it should be backed up, it has a user id
and group id of 1000, the length of the path is 8 bytes, the size
of the file it 11288 and it has "bin/rdup" as a path.
.PP
Directories are always printed, as the modification time of directories
is not compared.

.SH OUTPUT FORMAT WITH \-c
The output generated by \fBrdup -c\fR is formatted like:
        +|-TYPE BITS UID GID PATH_SIZE FILE_SIZE\\n
        PATH FILE_CONTENTS
.PP
This makes it possible possible for a remote shell script to receive the
actual file and make a backup.
.PP
All field are identical as described in \fBOUTPUT FORMAT\fR, but
there is one extra field and the following cavaets.
.TP
.B o FILE_CONTENTS
The entire file is concatenated to standard output.

.SS CAVAETS
The output when using the \-c is changed as follows, for:
.TP
.B o directories:
the FILE_SIZE is zero and no content is printed. Thus:
        +d 755 1000 1000 11 0\\n
        \fB/home/miekg\fR
.TP
.B o regular files:
the FILE_SIZE is used as-is and the entire file contents
is printed to standard output. Thus:
        +- 644 1000 1000 32 6\\n
        \fB/home/miekg/svn/rdup/trunk/aaa/a\fR\fIhello\fR

Where \fBaaa/a\fR is a regular file containing the word 'hello\\n'
.TP
.B o symbolic links:
the FILE_SIZE is set to the size of the target name and instead
of printing the file contents the target name is printed. Thus:
        +l 777 1000 1000 34 1\\n
        \fB/home/miekg/svn/rdup/trunk/aaa/def\fR\fIb\fR

Where \fBaaa/def\fR is a symbolic link that points to 'b'

.SH UTILITIES
Various perl scripts are included with rdup. Linked together these
script actually implement the backup scheme. 
.PP
The more important scripts are:
.TP
.B rdup-mirror
the main backup script that implements a mirroring backup. It also used
for remote backups (with the \-c switch).
.TP
.B rdup-snap
Create a (hard link) snapshot. Hard links saves space so you can keep
a very long record of previous backups. This is wrapper around
`rdup-snap` and `rdup`. Also supports the \-c switch.
.TP
.B rdup-gzip
acts as a compression filter.
.TP
.B rdup-crypt
acts as a encryption filter.
.TP
.B rdup-dump
a wrapper script around `rdup-mirror' and `rdup' that creates
a backup.
.TP
.B rdup-snapshot
a wrapper script around `rdup-snap' and `rdup' that creates
a hardlinked backup.
.TP
.B rdup-restore
a wrapper scripts around `rdup', `rdup-mirror' to ease restoring.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SS BACKUPS
\fBrdup-dump\fR is a wrapper which implements these (and more) pipelines:

.SS full dump of /home 
rdup /tmp/HOMELIST ~ | rdup-mirror \-b /vol/backup

.SS full gzipped dump of /home
rdup \-c /tmp/HOMELIST ~ | rdup-gzip | rdup-mirror \-c \-b /vol/backup

.SS full remote dump of /home
rdup \-c /tmp/HOMELIST ~ | ssh \-C miekg@example.com rdup-mirror \-c \-b /vol/backup

The \fI\-C\fR compresses the stream.

.SS full encrypted remote dump of /home
rdup \-c /tmp/HOMELIST ~ | rdup-crypt KEYFILE | 
ssh miekg@example.com rdup-mirror \-c \-b /vol/backup

.SS full encrypted, gzipped remote dump of /home

rdup \-c /tmp/HOMELIST ~ | rdup-crypt KEYFILE | rdup-gzip | 
ssh miekg@example.com rdup-mirror \-c \-b /vol/backup

.SS RESTORES
\fBrdup-restore\fR is a wrapper which implements these (and more) pipelines:

.SS restore of /home to /tmp/restore
rdup /dev/null /vol/backup/HOST/200604/home |
rdup-mirror -r -b /tmp/restore

.SH USEFULL EXTERNAL TOOLS
As \fBrdup\fR only prints names it depends on external tools and scripts
to make it really usefull. Luckily there are lots of those:
.TP
.B o cstream 
a tool the implement bandwidth shaping (for remote backups).
.TP
.B o dirsplit 
split a directory into DVD sized volumes for easy burning.

.SH FILES
\fBrdup\fR uses `@sysconfdir@/rdup' as directory where the timestamp
and filelist files are put, but this is completely overrideable by the
user.
