.SH NAME
rdup-cp \- copy files from rdup

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdup-cp
.IR DEST
[
.IR OPTIONS
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrdup-cp\fR copies the files it gets from standard input to the directory
\fIDEST\fR. This script can be used to restore files from a backup,
especially when the \fB-a\fR option of \fBrdup\fR is used.
.PP
The command line would look something like this:

.RS
rdup /dev/null FROM | rdup-cp DEST
.RE

Or when you need \fBrdup\fR to fill in the extended attributes:

.RS
rdup -a /dev/null FROM | rdup-cp DEST
.RE

\fIDEST\fR can only be a local directory.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a
Write the uid and gid information to the file's extended user attributes:
\'r_uid' and 'r_gid'. This option only works if \fBattr\fR is available
on the system. This currently works for Linux and Solaris 10.
.TP
.B \-p NUM
Strip NUM slashes of the path names, thereby stripping a common prefix
of all names.
.TP 
.B \-c 
Used in conjunction with \fBrdup\fR's \-c. Process the files' contents
also.
.TP
.B \-v
Echo the files processed to standard error.
.TP
.B \-h
Short help message.
.TP
.B \-V
Show the version.

.SH SEE ALSO
rdup(1) and cp(1).
