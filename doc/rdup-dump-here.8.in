.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdump-here.sh\fR is a graphical front-end for `rdup-mirror' and `rdup'.
Its main purpose is that it is used as `autorun.sh' on removeable media.
This way you can backup automaticaly when you power on or insert such
media.

The backup will be stored in the directory where \fBdump-here.sh\fR is
called from - usually this is in the root of the removeable media.
.PP
The script must be edited to be really usefull - as there is no
way to give it options (when run as `autorun.sh') the directories
to be backed up \fImust\fR be specifed at the top of the script.

.SH FILES
`pwd`/`hostname` is the default location for the backups. That is:
where ever \fBdump-here.sh\fR is located is taken as the backup
directory.
