[
.IR OPTIONS

.IR RESTOREDIR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrorrim.sh\fR is part of the restore utilities of \fBrdup\fR.
.PP
\fBrorrim.sh\fR is almost equal to \fBmirror.sh\fR, the only major
differences are:
.TP
.B o
When a filename with a backup suffix (+DD.MM:SS) is seen, the contents
of that file is copied, but the suffix is removed from the filename. 
Leaving the restored directory in its original state.
.TP
.B o
It can be that the file without the suffix does not exist in the
backup directory. This is possible when the file has permanently
be deleted from the filesystem. If this is the case the file in 
question is skipped from the restore.
.TP
.B o
There is no default location to restore to. A restore directory
must be explicitly given on the command line.

\fBrorrim.sh\fR restores an entire backed up directory (recusively) to
another directory. This allows one to return to a previous state of a
filesystem. 
.PP
By default \fBrorrim.sh\fR will restore to the last backed up state,
i.e the file you'll get when you run `yesterday.sh' without options.
.PP
Backed up files will be copied as-is, not unzipping are decryption will 
be attempted.
