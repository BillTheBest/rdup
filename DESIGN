RDUP DESIGN DOC


crawler

        the crawler decends into the directories.

        When a .nobackup is found the entry's value is changed
        from VALUE to NO_PRINT. The functions that write the
        list know that NO_PRINT values should not be written
        nor printed. 
        (The entry could no simple be removed, becaused that
        messed up the GTree).

        So in rdup each item (a path) can have three values:
        NULL - initial value, used by GTree to signal 'not found'
        VALUE - rdup uses this to differentiate between 'not found'
                and found items
        NO_PRINT - don't print items with these values
