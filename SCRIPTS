There a quite a few script included with rdup, they break down in 
a few categories, namely:

o mirror scripts
  mirror.sh

o auxilary support scripts
     o crypt.sh
     o gzip.sh

o restore scripts
  single files:
      o hist.sh
      o yesterday.sh
  mass restore:
      o rorrim.sh       --      opposite of mirrir.sh
      o monthday.sh     --      select what to restore
        
o  meta-wrapper scripts:
      o dump.sh - uses rdup and mirror.sh to locally dump the files
        to the backup filesystem.
      o restore.sh - uses rdup and rorrim.sh to locally restore files.  (todo)
      o dump-here.sh - uses rdup and mirror.sh to dump the files
        to the directory where dump-here.sh lives.
