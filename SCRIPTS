The following scripts are included:

mirror.sh
        mirror locally to another directory. It is prudent to put
        this directory on a seperate harddisk. Example:
        rdup -N ts LIST DIR | mirror.sh -b /vol/backup/HOSTNAME

        Where /vol/backup lives on another disk.

rmirror.sh
        perform a remote backup. As the output of rdup isn't sufficient
        for a remote backup we need `rcat.sh' to include the file
        contents in the backup. Example:
        rdup -N ts LIST DIR | rcat.sh | ssh -C user@remotehost \ 
         rmirror.sh -v /vol/backup/remote/HOSTNAME

scripts/hdup/
        an implementation of the core hdup2 idea, can be extended to
        work "just as" hdup2, but this will need a lot of config file
        parsing.

tools/
        yesterday.sh and hist.sh, scripts meant for users on systems
        that use rdup/mirror.sh. See their respective manual pages for more
        information.
