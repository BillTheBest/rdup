The following backup schemes are included:

mirror/
        mirror locally to another directory. It is wise to put
        this directory on a seperate harddisk.

remote/
        upload the contents of the backup to a remote host. This
        utilizes sftp. The following cmd line should work:
 rdup FILES DIR | ./sftp.sh -b /remote/dir | sftp -C -b - user@remote:

        Also a second remote scheme which is more powerfull has been
        implemented:
 rdup FILES DIR | ./throw.sh | ssh -C user@remote | ./catch.sh 

hdup/
        an implementation of the core hdup2 idea, can be easily extended
        to work "just as" hdup2.
