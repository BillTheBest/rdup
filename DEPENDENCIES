and tools to make it all work. The dependencies are listed here:

Mandatory:
o libglib (core C gtk library)
o libpcre (Perl regular expressions)
o libssl  (OpenSSL)
o libarchive (Create tar/cpio/etc archive - used in rdup-tr)

If libarchive is not found rdup-tr is not built.

To build from git:
autoconf && ./configure && make && make install

from tar.bz2:
./configure && make && make install

To run the testsuite:
make check

DejaGNU is used for the testsuite.

Some small shell scripts are included in the sh/ directory
they depend on bash, GNU date and GNU cp.
